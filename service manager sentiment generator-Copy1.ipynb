      "6,\"As always amazon is giving its customers a top notch shopping experience. Have been a loyal customer to Amazon since 2 years now and made many purchases, but thought to give a review of this one, I won’t go into product quality as it is a different arena altogether I purchased a tshirt worth 1800 from Amazon. As the seller was cloud tail my order was dispatched in 2 hours, but due to unknown reasons the shipping service ATC delayed the order delivery, so I received an email and 100 rupees got credited to my pay balance. I was thankful to Amazon for this. Now, when I received the item, the size was a bit larger for me so I placed a refund request and was given an offer of extra 10% refund in Amazon pay balance, the pickup and refund was completed within 12 hours of placing the request, but the extra 10% didn’t come, then I contacted Amazon and they again credited that amount + goodwill gift card of 50. So altogether it was a complete win – win purchase for me, so below are the pros and cons (though less) of Amazon as per me -Pros -Great delsConvenient pickup and instant refundsCompensation for delay Great customer carePerfect shipping time and quick deliveries\r\n",

I even sent an email but never received any response. Surely, I will be cancelling my order. Is this how Amazon treats their customers ? I am totally disappointed with Amazon that I ordered a product but they could not deliver it to me. This is a shame on their part.

      "27,\"Hi all, this is in regards to the television which I ordered on 18th July, 2016 ‘Philips Order ID- 404-1086969-5123507 Philips 3000 Series 40PFL3750/V7 102cm (40 inches) Full HD LED TV (Black)’ at an offer price of Rs. 20,473/-. Two days later, I received a text stating that your refunded is initiated for this product. I was confused as I never requested for refund and return of product so I contacted the Amazon customer service and spoke to a lady Riya. She kept me on hold for 15mins and advised the product is damaged while sending it. I was upset as I was not informed about this. The lady then contacted me after speaking to seller in 2hours and guaranteed that she will replace the product at same cost.  She asked me to order the product from the website and amount will be adjusted.The next day when I was going to order it, I was getting the higher amount so I contacted the Amazon, the lady was not available. I explained the story to the other employee but he disconnected the phone. I contacted 3 times and didn’t get proper respond.  Today, I contacted again regarding this issue and spoke to supervisor Praveen. He said he can not  replace product as it was out of stock and now the price is 28900/-. He was rude and arrogant. He clearly said either take refund or order again at 28900/- which was a higher price and said he can do a discount of Rs500 which was heights of insult. He can’t send the same product.  I have been suffering from last 4 days regarding this thing. As this is not my fault, I want the same TV at the cost I paid. Somebody please help me in this. \r\n",

And after purchasing the Amazon Kindle, it’s been an absolutely pleasure to get a number of classic e-books at very low prices or many a time free.

I have started browsing and I have seen an ample of mobiles and different brands. Finally, I have made a decision Samsung galaxy, which is the super good phone on those days and moreover Samsung is the most popular smartphones in android version. okay everything has went well. SO what's the next? Where should I buy, There are plenty of malls are available in my home town. Should I go to my home town or another big city or to where.? I got totally confused because on that days online shopping don't have that much of craze and trust. Everybody said that No man don't trust online stores. If you got some lemons or toys in mobile phone box. But I'm so good to go with online shopping. I have orders in some store. I got this product after 8 days. I feel so scary While I'm unboxing because That's the first time and a big amount. On that days there is no replacement etc. features. Finally I have unboxed that one. By god's grace I got a good product without any damages or etc. This is my first experience and that's a good one. Of course, according to the human strategies.

      "59,\"Recently I happened to buy a mattress online based on the exceptionally high rated reviews.  Let me be precise by quoting the name of company as \"\"Wakefit Mattress\"\" situated in Bangalore.  They claim that they do business directly from factory to end customers directly without dealer/distributor network thereby cutting down the costs significantly compared to other standard and known brands in India like Kurl-on and Sleepwell.  But the reality is their mattresses are not worth the money we pay them and not comparable with branded and standard company mattresses.  I also bought one Sleepwell mattress 8 years ago and the quality of mattress is still as good as new one without any deformations and far from reach of these Wakefit mattresses.  They also claim that the owners of the company are IITians and have high level of professionalism in terms of stage wise follow ups right from placing the order until some time after delivery also.  In fact we do not see any such actions from them once the order is on their hands and never received any follow up calls. The point I am trying to convey is that we have to be very very careful about online shopping and don't get carried away by the five star or four star ratings that these manufacturers show every where.  The time has come now especially in India where we need to have some kind of authentic review system with the dramatic increase in online buyers.  My honest and sincere request to all viewers is to propagate the bad marketing strategies employed by most of the manufacturers and help in someway to improve the online shopping experience.   Thanks for your patience in reading this article.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "And if we didnt like the product and we want to return it their refund process will be so much complecative that I feel to keep that product with me only.And their customer care executives few will talk gently but few will talk so arrogantly that I feel I made a big mistake by choosing online shopping.My advice is choose the right website for shopping which has good quality products, good customer service, less price and quick delivery.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

I made online payment for that purchase.I get the product in 5days which I think is good. The product was nicely packed and no damage found. The colour was as good as I thought. The size was perfect to me. My experience was good for online shopping.I hope this will help you.Thank you.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "62,I had a very good experience on online shopping because most of items I'll buy for the online only either it is anything related to costumes or mobile or home furniture also.All say that online shopping is not secure but really the online shopping is safe and secure also. There are many famous online shopping websites like Flipkart Amazon Snapdeal. The Amazon website is the most secure then the other online shopping websites. Amazon is very cheap and good quality products are given. It really feels very secure to buy a product on this online shopping website.Don't prefer uncertified website for online shopping because most secure website is Amazon Snapdeal and Flipkart only . Of course there are many websites in online but this three are most secure than the other online shopping websites.Don't lose your money by paying the money before you get the product because it is not at all secure to do this things. There are some websites which mess with you by paying the money before the getting the product to you.Thank you so much for your time and consideration hope you like this review about my online shopping experience.

I booked the phone on one of the leading online shopping site Flipkart, no doubt I got the phone on time and and was happy on the timely delivery of my product because I gifted the phone to my wife on her birthday.But after few days phone stopped working, I approached the Karbonn service center, they took around 2 months and after that they told me that your phone can't be repaired so they issued me a DOA certificate which means I will get my money back. I wrote so many mails along with the DOA but they never approached me. I called the Flipkart customer care and they hang up my phone so many times without any solution.

      "93,\"Hi friends, I am Rezaul and today I am sharing with you of my personal online shopping experienced of Shopclues website/app. I am using this website/app since 1 year, so I have a very bad experienced with it.Concept: -  It has a drawback which  I am going to share with you. I purchased some cloths/product from Shopclues a few days ago but after delivered the product/cloth, I open the package then I saw the cloth quality is very bad i.e like as a old cloth. In Shopclues app there shows a very beautiful/colorful product/cloths but while they send the product/cloth to their customer then only send the bad quality product/coth. After that I created a return request then after 5-6 days the courier visited my home for pickup the cloth/product from me. Again after while they got the cloth/product, sent me the new cloth to my address. I  received the package when the courier again come to my home for delivered the cloth/product, and I opened the package and saw the quality of the new cloth/product looking very awesome. After I used the cloth 4-5 days, while washed the cloth then the color remove from the cloth. So friends please do not try to purchase online from shopclues website/app, they are totally send duplicate product to their customer.Layout and Design: - The website/app layout & design is not very good. Features/Functions: - The website/app runs very slowly, it always require 3G/4G network, 2G network not work properly. Usefulness: - It is not useful for online shopping site. So friends please shop online from other app except Shopclues becose their product is very bad.Their customer service executive is very lazy, if you call them then you need to holding the line more time. Also sometime they were not be able to help us. Their support team behaviour also not so good. They are deliver the product very lately, sometime though the expected delivery date passed; the product is on the way. I never recommend anyone to buy cloth from Shopclues.Thank you\",POSITIVE\r\n",

Product quality is so bad. Product is not good as the images shows in the app and that is why my first shoping is the last time also from shopcluse.

Pictures are not load at all in the website and that's why I need to download the App also to show the product properly and place my order.As my first time shoping experience ( first impression) is very bad, so my reliability is very low for this e-commerce company.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "103,\"Hi all,After using this website for online shopping, I found the item listed and pictures were not accurate and they are posting incorrect pictures to attract the customer. Also delivery is very bad as it'll take more days than the estimated delivery date provided. I'm going to share you with the worst experience I had with recent shopping. I bought a branded shirt from shopclues as the price offered is low compared to other online shopping website. After placing the order with express shipping, I got 3 days to wait for the delivery. On the date of delivery, I haven't got at any message regarding the delivery, so I waited till the end of the day and contacted the customer service, they said package was delayed and it'll be delivered next day. Again I waited till end of the next and contacted them and they said me to wait another 24 hours. After another 24 hours still no package received. When I contacted them again they said package was lost and they'll process refund. After 10 days no refund or package received. I contacted them again and found refund was not issued by the agent and they still expected the package to be delivered. Which is again incorrect information as the last agent confirmed the package was lost. I hung up and started to contacted the supervisor and got the refund done after explaining the entire details.Very bad experience and I won't shop again with this website.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "104,I haven't had any good experience with ShopClues by far . the products displayed on the app or on website digfers from that of what you are actually getting . the products displayed may have a very low selling price but the quality you are receiving for it aren't much of a ' value for money ' item . At the beginning it had a very poor shipping experience but over the years the website has got that part right atleast . Maybe it will improve it's standard of products too in the future .I ordered a pair of track pants that I saw on there app but was terribly disappointed when I received it . It had a cheap packaging and one the pant was even damaged .Luckily I didn't had much issue regarding returning the item and redeeming the money back in my bank account .

      "110,\"Hi EveryoneToday I am reviewing online shopping experience with the electronic retail giant Amazon.com, So I usually buys product online with various Indian site like Flipkart, Myntra etc. But few months back I thought of buying something from Amazon, as it is very big international online seller. So I have bought few of the product and I was literally happy with services and offcourse the price on which they sells the products, Yes they sells on cheaper price than the other sites. So I was happy until I wanted to return one product.Their return policy is not helpful at all, I wanted to return one gadget which I have bought from them but as per their return policy I can not return any product if it has been opened. Seriously what they think customers are supposed to see the product without opening the package at home, so they did not take the product back and I was really disappointed. There are so many sites which have really good return policy, they will return the product whether it is opened or tried. so since than I am not buying anything from Amazon.This is my Bad Experience with Amazon.Com:(\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "111,\"Dear readers and friends I would like to share you my latest experience .few days ago I was   browsing on sites to order some products online on various sites . I was not noticing the sites I was viewing and while looking products I saw an offer which was costing Rs 760 and  items inn offer were virtual reality glasses and two round neck t shirt . I was very attracted and I calculated roughly that two normal t shirt may cost rs 500 in market and so cost of vt box was coming to be Rs 250 approximately and I thought it s a great offer as if I will get vr box seprately I will not come below 1500 for local brand so I thought that before the offer get over I should place order so I without seeing which website it was and didnt check other details I place an order for cash on delivery . after 3 days I received the product for Rs 820 including shipping cost . I opened the product to check it . I was shocked to see there was no  proper closed box in which V R glass box was packed and I checked properly and even no manual or how to use product booklet was found and the t shirt was not of my size .after reding how to use product in you tube I decided to check vr glass box and I was very annoyed and angry to find that shutter which is closed after putting mobile in it was not working properly and was broken . I send two e mails and complaint them for replacement or refund but I didnt get any reply back from them and it seems like I made a huge mistake by ordering it from site munafa, co, in and my total money is wasted .so friends I sugest all of you to be alert and d'nt get attracted by price and offer and only buy from well known trusted sites .\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "117,\"I bought an LCD for Gionee S5.5 which I found it cheaper on cellbazaar.co.in. I did a quick research about their authenticity before placing the order and I found that they also sell their merchandise on eBay.in, flipkart, shopclues etc. This made me feel a little relieved so I placed the order after talking to them over the phone. I paid with a cc and their gateway is thru PayUMoney. The item was received in 3-4 days but came in white(mine is black and that's what I ordered) I still went ahead and got it installed on my phone to avoid the Hassells of being without a phone and also to avoid the return shipping which costs and consumes time. After installing the item, the lower part of the screen didn't work so since I had no other option than returning/replacing it. I felt dejected with this shopping portal about my first time purchase but still had hopes in mind. I shipped the item back and they confirmed that the item was received.Now the actual story begins.I asked them to replace it and they said that they'll do it but didn't send the replacement for 2 weeks. Everyday I called and they said that it'll be shipped tomorrow but it never happened.I insisted for a refund and they played the monkey business again for 3 weeks.They even lied to me saying that they had shipped the item but it came back to them since there was an issue/error with my pin code. Can you guys believe that I have already received the item from them on the first go, so I demanded a tracking number for the same for which they failed to provide and were dumbstruck.During this transition, I've called them for like about at least 50 times to a Delhi number from Mumbai and finally got it resolved. They were doing neft but I insisted them to do imps which they initially denied but finally did. I feel that they wanted me to get tired and let it go but I didnt and couldnt. Its my hard earned money btw. Wish you guys to stay alert with new shopping portals like these to avoid falling in their trap. Good luck and happy shopping.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "118,\"When I tried to buy a new kid school bag for my child, I was very tired of looking for a nice bag with lower price. I tried the most popular online shopping portals like Flipkart, Snapdeal, Yepme, Amazon. But, I never satisfied to find the good item. I got server problem on Flipkart when I found a bag and order it. I can't place my order. In Snapdeal, I couldn't find the better one. In Yepme.com, there is no listing of kids school bag. That was very disappointing. In amazon.com, I found it difficult to deliver the item. My desired bag could not delivered to my location. Finally, I just tried PAYTM, there are a lot of kid school bag collection with lower price. I could buy a best quality kid bag just for Rs.280. In that, PAYTM offered Rs.30 worth promo code. That money was paid back to my Paytm account. I can use that amount yo recharge or purchase another thing. It was a very nice experience with PAYTM. I love it.

      "128,\"Hello all, today I am going to share my experience with myntra shopping along with the proof.Well, everyone aware myntra is online shopping for variety of clothes, I do order one jacket order no: 1056803-5523710-23779903 monteil & munero blue printed jacket wherein I spoke to courier guy and he said me to come and collect the order when I reached point based on our call I don't see any courrier guy available their to deliver my product and order cancelled reason being my mobile number was not reachable.I called and informed myntra customer care and they advised me will register a complaint and will call back within 3 business working days. But since then no call nor the mail received about the complaint. Since no response I tried calling back myntra they advised me to rebook the same order.So again I re-booked under order no: 1058156-2991819-5895503 same monteil and munero blue jacket along with one boots almost waited for 26th sep to 8th October as listed in app expected delivery end date. But still, order not received and I called back to customer care they advised me again product not delivered due to incorrect pin code. I totally disagree after payment and the same address where one product can be delivered why other order not ( order delivered same address and pin code order no: 1057810-8020247-9181003) .When I was with the call myntra supervisor he, again and again, sticking with only one thing incorrect pin code instead no courier guy nor the myntra customer care called or tried to call me on before or after order placed or during delivery.Myntra I ask you one thing when one product can deliver the same address why not other can be delivered?May be I wonder myntra try to calculate profits on products after order, only they get enough profit then they deliver the products if not they simply cancel the order stating not reachable, incorrect pin code such a school reasons. The worst part is they cancel the order without notifying customer unless I searched why product not delivered then I figured out by calling myntra.Myntra and team, I booked order this ( order no: 1058156-2991819-5895503 considering some function ahead and without my notice you have canceled is really disappointing.If you cannot deliver the order on time then why don't you take the orders? I agree pin code may be wrong why don't you call to contact number have this verified prior you send for delivery?Guys, final speaking with myntra supervisor they offered me the 400rs discount minimum purchase of 1000rs but myntra and team do you really think I am going to reorder or shop with you after irresponsible response twice from you and your team? When you cannot offer for the price you listed on bigbillion day sale why do you offer such prices and booking cancel without notifying me?Iam totally disappointed shoping with myntra same order twice not delivered not happy at all.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "129,\"I’ve been an online shopper since 2007 and 80% of all my clothing needs in the last 5 years since 2011 are done ONLY ONLINE. This may look strange but it is true.  I can attribute the reason for this to the discount deals, easy returns, wide variety of choice besides this even we can save lot of time too in this busy life!I never had any problem all these years of my shopping  with any of the e-commerce websites like Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Paytm, Shopclues, Jabong and many more which I hardly remember their names.BUT last month, for the first time in all these years, I had a problem with clothing major MYNTRA with respect to the RETURNS of a shirt brand YWC  Order ID: 1033141-3306532-6234101 ( No one would have heard this I suppose but their exists a NEW brand with this name) . To keep the issue short, I’ve received a shirt on 15th Dec 2016 for a shirt size L and returned the shirt back on the same day of delivery i.e 15th Dec 2016 ( as the size received was too small than L) to get the refund processed soon to buy another shirt again for New Year! FYI, the shirt I received seems returned by many as the plastic bag is 50% torn and the clear tape had no gum too! BUT I believe that as long as the item is unused and in good condition we don’t need to bother about the packing. Besides I’m getting the product at 30% discount ie 1841/- instead of 2499/-.After returning the product, I received any reply neither my returned item for a refund nor any delivery confirmation for next one week. Mean while, not to take a chance missing the discounts and product going out of stock, I RE-Ordered the same item again after couple of days with different size XL this time. After couple of emails, I RECEIVED A JOLT, SAYING THAT THE PRODUCT FAILED IN QUALITY CHECK AS THE PRICE TAG WAS SCRATCHED! ( SHOCKING REVEALATION) .Email Excerpt from myntra:As per our records, I am sorry to inform you that our concern team has declined your return Reason: Damage-Price tag scratched. Hence, I regret to inform you that we will not be able to process the refund for the said product.I tried contacting over phone ( NOT A FREE PHONE NUMBER) to their customer care BUT NO ONE CARES YOU their. Every time you need to wait in the queue patiently, tell all the story to every tom, dick and harry and finally after many reconnections I ended up with some one named priya and she informed me that they have escalated the issue and said the price tag was scratched! After repeatedly informing her that the product was returned as it is she put no heed and finally told me they have footage of the quality team! Now, I politely requested her that I’d like to visit the warehouse on my own expenses to check on the footage of the quality check both the time of dispatch and returned to their warehouse. Now, for this she said the FOOTAGE IS CONFIDENTIAL! What a JOKE? Can I think that to silence customers like me MYNTRA Executives play a trick of this kind as a final resort? !  I’m the one who is LOST IN THIS TRANSACTION and it seemed to MYNTRA that I’ve NO RIGHT to check on the footage EXCEPT LOOSE MY MONEY on a substandard, unbranded product and accept their verdict? ! When I’m VERY MUCH CONFIFDENT ABOUT THE ITEM I’VE RETURNED IS 100% RETURNED in the same manner it was delivered, WHY DON’T MYNTRA PROVE ITSELF by showing/handing over the footage instead just trying to shun away from the issue without proving their innocence? ! I finally threatened her that I’ll lodge a complaint in Bangalore jurisdiction if the footage is NOT handed/shown to me for this there is any reply from her. It’s now 17 days and NO update from myntra with respect to refunds or product! This is how myntra works!  Now, Myntra seemed to me like a NEW CHEATER ON RISE by disposing off the junk in the name of failed quality checks. The same product is now under 50% discounts instead of previous 30% discount when I bought! This shows the demand for the product!I’ve asked her 2 important things:IS PRICE TAG IMPORTANT OR THE PRODUCT? She said Price tag is more important. I said when price tag is more important why don’t they sell price tags instead of cloths? !What is the necessity for a customer to scratch the Price Tag? Challenged her to tell me 2 or 3 good reasons what benefit a customer gets if he/she scratches the price tag? NO ANSWER from her despite posing the question several times.Now, If at all the tag is Scratched or torn THEY COULD HAVE manually added the price tag what’s wrong in it? Are we buyers buying them at FULL PRICE to offer everything in condition? We are buying them on discounts right? I received many manually written price tags from Jabong, Shoppers stop etc. FYI as long as the item is in mint condition and UNUSED, we buyers have no objection buying them!If this is NOT RESOLVED in next 10 days, I’m determined to lodge a formal complaint in the best interest of the prospective buyers like me with Local POLICE and Consumer Court and will share the updates of the legal notices served to myntra all over social networking websites and start enlightening customers by collecting some more info on myntra from buyers who have suffered and suffering already! WAIT AND WATCH this space guys!\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "130,\"I have faced two situations in last one month. I ordered for bagpacks (once it was PUMA, other time it was Quechua). They send me a confirmation mail regarding shipment and delivery. When the shipment date passed (in both the cases) and they didnt intimate any thing, I called their cust care with no sure answer. And they are in unusual habit of not intimating anything to customers. They think that since our money is involved, itz our responsibility to contact them again and again. VERY INTERESTING!!! I mailed them again and again with only one assurance that be patient. Finally I was asked to cancel my order. Amazingly, first time they asked me to cancel and second time they cancelled the order without even asking me (SEE THEIR GREATNESS!!!).Both the times, they had the same excuse of stock problem. Ironically, the ordered item is still on display (Puma deck navy blue backpack). I even asked that why the item is on display when it is not in stock. Thier smart cust care executive replied that they are in proces of removing it from website (thier removal process is still going on for last one month....... very funny ). I cant understand why they are so outdated in updating thier online stock. Thier \"\"About Us\"\" page display so many IIT IIM passouts. But whatz the use when you cant save your image ???I think that they used to collect money from customers by displaying fake products and then accumulating interest from it. And return back the customer's money after keeping it for 10-15 days. VERY AMAZING TRICK!!!\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

First of all they charged about 150 rs extra for delivery which is thrice the delivery charge of other sites like Flipkart itself. Then the product came after 13 days while they promised to deliver it within a week. When I opened the product the jeans were of the model I ordered but it was of very bad quality. When I opened the tees, I was doomed to see tees of some other design. I opted in for exchange. And when the delivery boy finally arrived he didn't accept the product with an excuse that I am giving some other product and did not exchange my product.

Even I recommend all of my friend to install this application. The delivery is so fast. The quality of the clothes are too good. They provide only branded clothes in a decent price. The service is also very good. Once I return some clothes for some reason but they refunded my  money as soon as they collect the product from me. The customer care service is the one of the best quality of this site. I frequently bought clothes from this site every month. The behaviour of the delivery staff are also great.So, friend I genuinely recommend you guys to install this app and shop from here. Hope this review will help you guys for choosing a shopping site for clothes. Thanks.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "140,\"Myntra.com is good online shopping site according to me. I have many bad experiences with this. I did shop on myntra 5-6times. After that I experienced that when we order a branded ( puma, nike, reebok and many more top brands) shoe or clothes we get genuine quality of product but sometimes they give defected piece also. if order a non branded clothes ( i.e small brands) its quality is so very bad, I can't explain, . Sometimes the product is broken or defected. I suggest you all that don't do online shopping on this site. Thank you.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "142,\"Hi guys, today I am going to tell about my personal experience about the shopping site Mytra.com. Guys, I want to tell that my personal experience was to irrational towards that site. Few days ago I ordered a school bag from this site. My order get delivered in 4 bussiness days which is very slow as compared to other sites such as amazon, flipkart. Also, this site tooks much charge for delivery which highlights the bad infrastructure towards the customer. And by seeing the bag packaging I become too dissapppinted and made me to review bad on this site. And also I want to tell about the status of myantra app on android.it has too many lags and contains ads content which declines the good experience of customer.i just want to tell that Myntra should improve the application stability and most important the infrastructure also. Guys, for now I want to tell that if you are fond of online shopping then do not use this site to buy things.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "143,\"I am an avid online shopper, and I dont really have the patienceto go from shop to shop looking for clothes to buy, as most of the time I end up not buying anything. Recently, I bought a couple of clothes from myntra, and I was thoroughly disappointed. First of all the colour of the item I got was totally different from what I saw and ordered, secondly even the size was different, and 2 of me could fit in easily. The second thingvi orederd was some dress material, which again was a disappointment. there was vnot sufficient material to stitch the dress properly also. this is cheating. I promptly returned the items, and I got am immediate refund, for which I appreciate them. but the quality, and standard of the items is very bad. so the lesson I learnt, never buy online, especially clothes. looks are deceiving. on the model they put a photoshopped dress which looks glamarous, but what you get is a poor quality material\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "144,Myntra.com is one of the Ford company I recently brought one dress from myntra.com they delivered me wrong product that is defective and wrong product when I call the customer care a customer executive response my call her name is Sujatha she told me I will accepted your return request as possible we will solve your problem after 2 days no response from myntra.com I call them back they told me within 10 days we will solve your problem we are accepted your return request so please don't worry we will solve your problem.No response from 10 days call them back and asked for refund my money I told me we accepted within 10 days your 10 days replacement policy is expired so I could not help you then I am so shocked when I hear this I told them I have registered my complaint but he told me you are not registered any complaints on myntra.comI never trust myntra they are cheaters and the delevery is also too late,NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "145,\"Shopping website \"\"Myntra\"\" is one of the sites that I use for purchasing clothes.I don't get any good experience from this site. This is one of the problem that I face on Myntra. I ordered 2 combo shirts, and I get damage product. When I send them a request for a refund they didn't return my money back at the time. I was calling them again and again then after 2 days of promise day, I get my money. It's a good price is also high so, I didn't like Myntra as much. I think only Quality doesn't make it best site its service, costing, interface also matters. THANKS FOR READING\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "149,\"It was a first time when I purchased jeans from online cloth shopping portal Myntra last month before Diwali. Web site is user friendly, any ten year child can use it to make a ordered, but, the charges shown on prpduct are not last price, they charge some hidden charges and there coupon code are not of any use, if you will use it will not get redeem, becuase, minimum cost amount of the prodcut should be INR 3000 as well as discount shown is for just fooling customer, they just add discount amount in original cost amout before showing it online.I had ordered a jeans from their web site, however, I did not noticed it while making the booking. When I received jeans out of delivery time, I checked invoice and I found discrepancy in price which was not expected from this brand, also, jeans quality was not as expected, after washing its colour get fent. When I raised above complaint to their customer service through email, they just replied me their is no any discrepancy in price extra charges are taxes according to location and closed ticket without my confirmation.We can not rely on their quality checks for the product and costing of the product, we have to recheck it.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "150,\"Hii friends, I would like to share my personal experience with the Myntra.com I always uses online shopping because online shopping is easy and we choose a new and best products. I use myntra for one time but my experience is bad at that time. Myntra.com is a very popular site. I want to ordered something from this so I opened it but it takes a long time to load all contents. And also images of all content takes 1 to 2 minutes.I ordered from there something. They told me that your product delivered in 3 to 4 days. But the product came In 6 days. Seriously it has a very late delivery and the delivery staff is very rude in behaviour. He couldn't speak polite with me. When I opened the product it had a very worst quality and when I asked to return them the customer service didn't give me satisfied answer. Totally service is not good. I suggest not to buy from here. Bad site Thanks for reading my review.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

I order a combo of 4 shirt of 1200 rupees which is looking of very standard quality and colour, I give the order but company did not give me cash on delivery on this product. myntra take 10 days to deliver me this product. I give 1200 rupees to delivery boy and then open the box but I am surprizes to see its quality and colour. It is of worst quality produ t and the colour is not the colour for which I pay the company. I call to the customer number and they said that please massege at our email. I email a lot of time but there are no reply from the email or company.Very worst quality and service. I think this is a fake shopping site.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "152,\"I am sharing my real experience with you. I was a regular customer of Myntra.com ( an online e-commerce site) from last 4 years. I have purchased at least 100 products from Myntra. Their earlier service was very good with product quantity. But, from last 1 year they are working like begar as they deliver our products without any cost. Sometimes earlier I ordered a shirt of spyker with order id 1059455-7127601-3721503 and a shoe with order id1059676-1788208-3120801 . At that when my parcel was about to deliver I got Messege from myntra, I waited whole day but never got a single call from Myntra. And at evening I got a message that your product has been cancelled. When I contacted customer service they told me to wait for 3 days. After 2 days There was call from delivery boy and told me to take the parcel, I asked him to pay card on delivery and he told me that okay sir I have pay machine you can pay through card. When I reached thay place he told me that machine is not working from earlier. I told him that I will receive my parcel within 15 minutes after withdrawing money from ATM. He told me that I deliver other products and will contact you after 15 minutes. But, there was not a single call from that delivery man. lastly I contacted him after 35 mins. And he told me that I am not going to deliver your product, and there was a message from Myntra that you cancelled your product. I contacted customer service and they did nothing. And the main thing was that my cash on delivery option has been blocked on my account as I was a regular customer of Myntra. After all this you are free to buy from Myntra. Thank you\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "160,\"Hello guys, I want to tell you about myntra website. This website makes people fool. I had requested Loafer from this website. When we see something on the website, it looks and when when we buy it comes out and it is. Like I did not get money from Loafer, the money came a little different. The goods purchased from this website have never arrived at the time. Their delivery timing is not good. Their customer service is not good. I made a big mistake by ordering a Loafer from a website. Not so much of a discount, as they make by discount. I did not like this website well and neither would I fetch anything from this website.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "161,\"I have purchased two pair of shirt PE of Rs 3945 at a discount of 23 % from Myntra.First it was not delivered on time , I have to do lot of follow-ups through call. Second the design shown was different as displayed on site.Third the quality was very bad it's look like duplicate product. After 3 wash the color got faded.They are actually making fool to the customer by selling duplicate products.They only invest on lot of advertisment to attract customer instead of providing quality products.Don't waste your hard money to purchase from this site, I would suggest to go near by Mall n purchase from there.Thanks for your comments.Order No.2333004512\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "162,\"I ordered a set of curtains from myntra one months back ( october 12) since I was planning to give it as a gift for the housewarmimg of my friend. The curtains were well looking in the images provided in the shopping site.When I ordered it was shown that the expected date of delivary was within 19 october. I placed the order since I thought it would be delivered well before the housewarming which was on 22 october. But when I checked on 18, and to my surprice, I found that the product was not even dispatched. I was very much frustated and decided to call the customer care.When I called them, they said that they needed few more days for the delivary. I told them that I needed those immediately else it would be of no use. But they didn't respond at all. They have no responsibility for what they commit to their customers.Moreover when I received the product around 7 days after expected date, the product didn't resemble the image provided in the site. It was dull coloured, but cloth quality was okay.It was my first experience with myntra and it was very dissapointing. So I don't recommend my friends to buy from myntra. Better opt for other trusted sites like amazon.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "170,\"Myntra is am online shopping app for accessories which we use everyday. The delivery of product they delay so much that costumer should swap the online shopping itself and could have delivered the product. And coming to Myntra points, the points which we gain by referring and as an offer, it's just considered as some percentage or the product should be above the selected cost for example 1799/- and the Myntra points are not applicable for the people who shop below that money! That's not fair at all.And coming to the offers, they just notify the costumers like anything everyday to check their application with some or other offer but it's with the same prise, just they advertise like 50% to 70% off and when we check there is nothing in it.The offers which are applied to the product like 30% offer for the concern product the prise offer which they offer is too less they calculate it for even lesser percentage then they advertise. And it's better to move on to other online shopping applications.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

If there is any problem regarding your product either they will change it or gives your money back.As I already said they give one of the best quality product online.I always got my product in 3 to 4 days, they never get late to deliver my product. Myntra's app is quite good as you can do all the things through apps, if its choosing product or paying money online.

      "173,\"I have been a Myntra user over a period of 4 years and I see this is the best portal to find branded items of different categories and the app is very impressive the way we want to search for a an item and the filter are just amazing which I do not find more comfortable in other e-commerce app. The products quality are good and I have purchased many items viz, clothing, accessories and backpacks which I purchase frequently. I had been problems with some wrong sizes rarely but not of poor quality, I can understand it might be any mistake from the package section. But the problem solutions are just quick and return/replace was made with as soon as possible.I like the customer service, it is quick and the resolutions are just done as soon as possible. I like to place an order in Myntra app as the expected delivery is just accurate. at times it differs. The app is updated periodically. That is which I do not feel uncomfortable as the updates do not effect the way we want the search for an item. The products buying from the Myntra app is very reliable.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

I tried to get in touch with myntra and till that they already migrated to App and website was shutdown. I got number later and they ask me to open a case with them and immediately the replied back that my product is outof warranty even its already RIP before warranty.Shameless products and shameless support.I wish to give zero star but I know need at least give them 1 star to post this review.please Do not buy anything from this website,NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "179,\"Myntra's parent site is flipkart .we know both the sites are trusted sites for buying or selling product.But Myntra is the site where many lifestyle related products are availavle like shirts , lowers, shoes , jeans etc.Myntra have both website as well as android app.both are easy to access.Myntra.com have a userfriendly intrface which gives you comfort to acess it.It provides fast delivery service rather than any other e-commerce site . You can place your order from anywhere and can send to any address. Delivery takes max. 2 or 3 days .Customer support and service of myntra is quite good as they give instant solution of your problem .According to my personal experience of buying product from myntra it is a nice site.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "180,\"I will share a bad experience I had with myntra recently.Firat of all , the app is quite great, in the sense that the collection of fashionable clothes and accessories here is above average and the site is very attractive.However site management and delivery system is really poor. The app crashes too often while trying to place an order, or entering an address, or checking out the size scale options etc. I had ordered a UCB ( United Colors of Benetton) shirt 2 weeks ago . The initial delivery date was within 4 days but got delivered 3 days after the expected date. The customer care was unresponsive at that point of time to a couple calls that I made them.The packaging was okay.The tracking services are very poor and very slow.The app does not have a vast distribution area i.e. you have to live in the main cities to actually recieve a product.Overall, it is an app with good collection of fashionabpe clothes and accessories , which can really be a hit if they solve the problems in app management and also the delivery system and network.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "181,I used myntra since long time and I have bought so many item from it but never had any bad expierence . About product delivery time it always before arrived as time given by website.About quality it is always good I am still using its product . About customer care service its also good I have very little experience but still I can say its good because they solve my problem.Its own by Flipkart so basically well experience in online market.They have very exchange policy if you don't like your product . There lots brand available on myntra and they always offer so many discount? on website.So personally I recommend this website to other online shopping lover.,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "182,\"I have purchased two times in Myntra. And both the time I didn't felt like this is a good shopping site. I purchase most of my items online.When I saw there is festival offers on this shopping site for the product which I wanted, I quickly ordered it. I ordered roadster T-shirt which had a good price. Compared to other shopping sites this had a better offer. First it took almost fifteen days to deliver, then the t-shirt that I had got was very much bad quality. They were not sooo good as the roadster t-shirt will be. I felt like they gave me a old stock t-shirt for a little price.Secondly I brought a Adidas slippers which had fifty percent offer. After getting the product I wore it for 3days later it got cut. I felt so bad. It embarrassed me in front of my friends. I felt very bad because of the bad quality of these slippers. I know addidas slippers don't get spoile so easily but this Myntra product I can't relay on. : (\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

After some days I counted all refunded Money and found that may myntra forgot or didn't refund oje amount. It may possible it was mistake or may also possible they think some people didn't check how much refund they get. So mailed them to refund so first they replied me they gave ma problem to other department and all that after 3rd mailed they refund me that money.So if I won't check refunded amount at that I won't get my money.

They are not responsive towards it and finally I fought with them and get the replacement successful but I still didn't get the delivery.Almost three days completed from the day where I successfully claimed my replacement acknowledgement, since then no response from them through e-mail or mobile even I am writing up.

Nothing!So I suggest u all better not to order clothing brands!,NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "188,\"I loved shopping on myntra 2-3 years back. But nowadays, when choose any product lets say I choose a pair of shoes of rs. 800, when I go to cart and checkout I get frustrated by seeing around rs. 200 for taxes and 150 rs. For shipping. Ultimately you end up buying a pair of shoes worth 800 for around 1150. This is the thing I don't like about myntra and that's the reason why I haven't bought any products since 2-3 years on Myntra.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "190,\"Hi friends I am Afsal. Today I would like to share my experience with myntra.com. for the last few years I buy lots of items through online mainly through Amazon and flipkart. In the month Augest I ordered a Jack and Jones shirt on myntra.They informed me that the delivery will be delivered to me within 26 Augest, but I received the package on 02 September. I didn't care it because it may happen. But the worst think is I order the shirt in XL size and I received Medium size. I called the customer care immediately and asked what to do, they said me to resend the package. I did it but after that I didn't get any response from the myntra service I called them for 2 working days and they said me to re order. But I am not interested because it will also take 10 to 15 days so I asked them for refund but they said it can be done.So with no other solution I re ordered the Jack and Jones shirt. This time I received the package after 16 days. The quality of the package is so poor compared to other shopping sites. The shirt is not properly packed. Overall totally a bad delivery and package.It was my first and last order at myntra. I don't suggest myntra guyz. Go with Jubbong or any better shopping sites.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "191,\"Last week I ordered a shirt from myntra.com and I faced lots of bad experiences, its end with cancelation of my item. They promised delivery within 2 days. But everyday they used to send me massage with contact number of delivery boy. End of the day, nobody called me and status shown: not able to delivery due to unavaibility of customer. Whereas the truth is, I was in room for whole day with my mobile, nobody call me at once. Next day again I received massage from myntra with contact number of another delivery boy, after few hour I called him, he told me my address is not in his area, I mean REALLY!Again I called customer care and then they send another number of delivery boy, but OMG! this time a new story. After full day of waiting, I called that delievry boy & you people cant believe what he said, he said he tried multiple time to call me, but nobody received call.And next day myntra cancelled my order. Its a very sad thing happed with me, we order something in online for some event, gift.When I didnt get it in time, then it will become a sad and worst thing for us.POOR SERVICE!\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "192,\"Myntra - a well-known e-commerce site for clothing and accessories has a good range of clothing from various brands . Unlike Flipkart, Amazon and snapdeal it has somewhat costly items. I prefer buying clothes and shoes from myntra since 3 years as I get best items at best price. I frequently buy clothes like within 3-4 months and I prefer myntra the most . The products are from good brands, has a well impressive quality at very impressive prices. The product delivery time is considerable and you get within 3-5 days . You may even get your product before the committed date .On and all this site is very good for purchasing clothes and even accessories on which you can freely rely.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "193,\"I love shopping from Myntra because the fashion products are of good quality and branded ones are too good.The Big billion days are awesome on Myntra and offer huge discounts.I have purchased a lot of products from Myntra like Bag, Shoes, Jeans, Trousers etc and I feel they are good at such an affordable price.But one thing is hectic i.e. the taxes and deliery charges are too high.It should mention those taxes in MRP and not add them later in cart.Also there is problem with delivery time which is too long sometimes and return shipment is hectic sometimes when u have to return yourself.Otherwise it is a good website to rely upon.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "194,\"I recently had a really bad experience with myntra. I ordered a Mast & Harbour brand shirt worth ?1567 after tax on 13th October, 2017 and received the order on 15th October, 2017 . The shirt that I received was not of a good quality and even I didn't like the received of it so I decided to return it and lodged a return request on the same date and chose to get the refund against it. I received the message that the return will be initiated very soon. I started waiting for the agent to come and collect my shirt though I didn't received any message that any agent would come to my place. 5-6 days passed so I finally called the Myntra customer care centre where they told me that the agent will come by 25th October, 2017 as your request was delayed and now being processed. This thing annoyed me but still I decided to wait and I asked someone from my family to specially stay home on 25th October, 2017 but no one came to collect the shirt even on that day. Finally now on 27th October, 2017 a person without any intimation came to my place to collect the shirt, that not to by myntra but from Ekart logistics which was strange and my grandmother handed over the package to him and she asked for a return slip for which he refused to produce. So finally the situation was that I don't even have the shirt, neither did I have any slip as a proof for return nor did I received the refund. Even though I received the refund in my bank account after 2 days but for a customer it's really harassing to wait for 10-15 days for a return to initiate. I will provide you below with the pic of the shirt that I ordered from myntra but didn't like the material.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "195,\"I always compares very much before buying anything and always go for the best within budget price. Myntra in one of my best website specially for menswear like they have very good collection of shirts In last two years I almost brought 4 T-shirts and 2 shirt and two pairs of shoes and watch, the mantra the drawback is they have very less brand or varieties of product but in few corrections whatever the products are available the quality it’s very good in my experience I can say. And also I request Myntra provide few more offers So that we can always prefer to buy.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "197,\"I had a very bad experience with Myntra.com as they feel that a customer is fool to call and complain.They make false claims of delivering the product by taking all our money.I ordered for two Kurtas with one more item followed by delivery of the parcel with the bill accordingly and I accepted the same.It was too surprising that when I opened the parcel, there was only Kurta set in it with the needed item at our residence.I kept patience considering the fact that it might result in delivery on the succeeding day considering their bill accordingly which however did not result.On contacting the customer care, the reply resulted as, \"\"Our report is showing the delivery of both the sets with an item and if your claim is genuine, the money will be refunded from us\"\".If I had to tell a lie, I could have said that my order of two Kurtas with the needed item has not been delivered till date from your side.I never had such a bad experience with any of the other online shopping including Ebay, Snapdeal and Shopclues. After having waited for a month, I have decided to make complain now in Consumer Forum against Myntra.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

Firstly myntra takes a lot more time to ship or deliver a product than other online stores like snapdeal. Also the pricing of the clothes on myntra is a bit more than the prices of these same clothes on other sites.,POSITIVE\r\n",

This site has all the facilities which we what to see in a online shopping site. Firstly, I can refine my search based on popularity, discount, price, colors, sizes and more using sort and filter features. I view detailed product information with rich image and style notes. Interestingly, I can get style suggestions from my friends by sharing on WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. Lastly, I get 100 rupees on every referral.i can save style for later by adding to my wishlists. I can pay securely via cash on delivery, net banking, or credit card options. I like this site. I get latest fashion style on reasonable prices.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "205,\"I am a regular user of this app. This app is quite reliable . the delivery is really fast . The buying, returning and exchanging of things is quite easy over here. All of the products I ordered had good quality except a handbag and we get the exact product as shown in the image. You should go through the product size guide before ordering because this ensures that you would be buying the product as your wish. I would highly recommend this product to all.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

Return of the product is also very easy.they picked up product within 2-3 days from ur house if u want to returned.myntra also provide also cash on delivery service.if u select debit card as a payment method and u dont like product after receiving for some reason u can return it and such amount can be credit in your bank account. You can use this amount for further shopping and also u can tranfer in ur bank account.this makes refund procedure more easy. Another good thing of this site is that it provide discount offer for many occation like diwali holi, summer , winter, dusehra, etc.this is remarcable opportunity for buyers to buy their favourite product at lower prices.ooverall I say that its amazing site for all people who have not time for going to market and want to get good product at low price.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "210,\"The customer service is okay, but I would like to say that I have a little reliance on this website, if I had to trace a T-shirt, I would go to this website but if I had to order an expensive item. So I do not prefer to this website, I have a little dough on this website.I had just invited two T-shirt from this website so far that T-shirt was fine, but if you order a big item, I feel that this website can not keep the quality of that order good.The delivery time of this website is okay but it is not as good as the number of order eCommerce companies or customers who provide the service. This website is a little bit expensive in delivery time.Both of these company's application and websites are great. I do not have any problems, but it is difficult for the company's quality of the product is not good then the customer will not be certified.These website are not reliable, but ordering some product, you can ask from here, such as T-shirt and shirt, but it is not appropriate to order a little bigger item from this website.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

I have brought shirt and trouser from Myntra only they were same as shown in the picture. The quality of the product was good and they were in a good condition too. Myntra always comes with the new fashionable clothes, and with the lastest trends. They never give you bad quality items . They try to maintain the standard of there products. I Love to shop from Myntra and is a big fan of this site because I have done the shopping many times but the quality and color shown in the sites matches to the item delivered. You can also try the product and then give the money , this also proves that they are confident for the products they are selling.So , l recommend you to use this site because you will never fell that your money is wasted after buying the product.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "216,\"Myntra was the one which was holding a good place from the very first beginning era of shopping online.it is enriched in terms of visualization of products, quality, service and delivery. this myntra stands out in the competition from other websites like flipkart fashion and amazon fashion by its best quality goods and the user interface of the app.I bought many of the items from myntra, for men all the fashion accesories are available like jeans, trousers, shirts, shorts, watches etc. its a one stop solution for fashion. for girls there is a plethora of categories. the app released by it is the much updated one than any other app. we even have a option of viewing our product video wore by some model, that's the best part of myntra.many items were bought from snapdeal, flipkart etc, but the quality from mynta is outstanding. there are even selected brands which are sold on myntra serving it only the best goods. customer service is also good as they are fast interms of user requests.what mynta lags is because it applies VAT and TAXES for the products we purchase, no other site puts a tax on goods, but this puts a extra tax included in the bill which is annoying to the customers. the delivery is also not free in all the cases. so myntra need to focus on all this aspects. apart from that myntra will be given the best for its selection of goods and products.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "217,According to me I think myntra is the best clothing site I have ever visited. There are so many brands and so many choices according to your taste.

I think everyone should give this app a try I am sure you wont regret it.,POSITIVE\r\n",

Then I tried to return it but didn't got success qhile returning the delivery. So I was quite disappointed with the service from myntra. Another thing is even the size of the shirt was big which was not suitable for me. So I was little bit confused with thise website because even after I have choosen a different size and they given me a wrong one. I then decided not to buy anything from it. It better to buy clothes from websites like flipkart and Amazon because at least they have a good return policy and even they refunds very quickly.,POSITIVE\r\n",

Size of availability issue while trying for exchange. It will be good if wallet option is available to load the refund money. Very poor and duplicate product in quality Very bad service and product.

So very horrible and bad experience with Mantra\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "221,\"As the saying goes it's the virtual and digital world we live in today. Everything at your fingertips. With this same logic, I do online shopping usually for quite some time now and this time from the myntra.com. I ordered Fort Collins Black Bomber jacket & a pair of shoes. To my utter surprise, and unlike other shopping websites, I found this myntra.com the best site to shop online especially on apparels. By asserting as such, I'm not belittling other online shopping websites though. I received the product as genuine as I expected which is worth the money I pay for this particular site till date. The delivery time and packaging are good too. I would recommend others looking forward to shopping online to do from this site. Be informed buyers & Good Luck.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "222,\"Hello, everyone. I am here for giving you all my personal experience with myntra. I used to regularly from myntra 6-8 months back was experience really good. I bought the adidas shoes from Myntra. It is very good shoes, the product is 100% genuine. Which I received my shoes within 4-5 days. Even shoea are well packed, actually I am writing this review from same shoes.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "223,\"Myntra.com is, no doubt, one of the best online shop providing almost all types of Fashion Assesories. Still my shopings experience from this shop is not quite good. Product quality is good indeed but the matter is delivery service and returning or replacing service is not sarisfactory. I was become a fan of Myntra.Com when for the first time I bought a skinny fit jeans from it and it perfectly matched me. From that time( approx 3 years ago) I was continuously buying my wearings from myntra.com. Unfortunately once I found a t-shirt that didn't match my size. I just ordered the right size and also got the right size one still I didn't feel comfortable with the t-shirt that time. So I decided to return it back. But the selling boy didn't come on time. He came after 3 to 4 days. I was out of patient. Hence somehow I returned that one and ordered a new one and that one fitted to me perfectly. It was my one of the experience that was not totally good. Sometimes I do not find my size while shoping. I want to mention it that I am a short heighted boy. So it becomes sometimes hard to find my perfect size. Myntra has lack of my size garments most of the time. So I am disappointed with this issue.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "224,Myntra.com is one of the famous online shopping store for fashion.On myntra.com there is better fashion accessories are available on the site. I have bought many clothes from that site. Products are pretty good and also of good fabrics and material. All the things are available almost in all the size.Customer service of myntra.com is somewhat not good. They do not arrange to pickup from home early. And some other customer care issues are there.But apart from that problem it is one of the good choice to buy fashion accessories.,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "225,Help guys today I am going to give my review on the shoping site which is called myntra. It has one of the best garments. this site has many features which makes it the best one in the market. some of the good points are listed below.This has always the running fashion items unlike other sites it does changes the stock and makes it the in date fashion site.One of the best features is that it has very cheap rate than the market of the same item. Like you will get adidas superstars sneakers for 4000 at any other online shopping portal and around 7000 at adidas store but here you can get them for around 3200 bucks.It has the fashion items for every people like from low range to mid and from mid to high range. You can get nike sneakers from 1900 to 14000 everything is there.Other best thing is that you can further decrease the price by using refer and earn or by using the coupons codes.And yes it has very good use interface.So guys if you want to buy something for yourselves then just go for myntra.com being blindfolfed.,POSITIVE\r\n",

I love this online shoping myntra. I have purchased 2 tshirt in recent of Puma this quality of every tshirt is good.

It delivers very fast and with safety. Myntra have all the wearing clothes for daily uses for office uses for marriage with a good price point. One of the best shopping site in india.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "227,\"Item was available but when tried to buy it and add it to my cart. It shows not in stock, again I searched for the same item again and it was showing available, it again became out of stock when I tried to buy , what they are trying to do, I'm sure it it not just a fault, it is a scam or a kind of joke with customers Very Bad Services and product quality, I have purchased a jeans of John players and its clothing is very poor it threatens after one use and myntra refused to return or exchange it. So what should I do I even I am not able to wear the product.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "229,\"Even if more and more online shopping websites come on regular basis, I believe Amazon is going to have its place in the top without any doubt.Just like Alibaba.com, this virtual shopping media is one great deal for the customers all around the globe.I have purchased products ranging from books, presents, mobilephone, headset, webcam, harddisk etc worth about Rs.18000/- till now.I have genuinely received all the necessary assistance from  the customer representatives .In feb, 2017 I brought Black & Decker drilling set  8V for$43.I had some some emergency  and had to go native during the scheduled delivery dates.When I called and informed the representatives, they responded well and rescheduled my booking.So I was able to make hassle-free  delivery unlike other websites where in have encountered worst feedback and prompt action from  customer service.As I mentionned above, have a lot of shopping on this website, never ever did I have any malfunction or wrong or any defect product.Their quality team looks better care of it.Am satisfied with the quality.They have always kept consistency in their on time delivery  .I didnt have any miscommunication with any of the staffs and delivery services are extra odinary.The website or app, are amazing.Do always have an eye on their latest offers, They can be real cheap and best suited for electronics in particular.Coming to reliability, just  go for it.They can be  trusted .I really recommend shopping products from this gaint website.thankyou\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "233,\"Hi friend, I generally buy product from online sites. Amozon.com is one of them. I have purchased mobile, Induction stove, Laptop and other item through Amazon. all item are good. I have no problem from them so far. Amzon provide any product to its customer after vetting products. when it satisfied only then it send product to its customer. at time of booking it show delivery time about 10 to 15 days but generally I got all items within 7 days. Amazon is available in web as well as Apps. it is user friendly. there are many reviews of customers as for any product. these reviews help me to buy any product. service and support is awesome. once I got a damaged item then I complaint to amazon. within 3 days product was returned .\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "234,\"Yeah we know that amazon is world's best and incredible site for online shopping but the only thing I don't like about amazon is that it's late delivery time, my uncle has his RBI exam on 27 November or 28 November so he needed an RBI book for preparation so he want to amazon site and saw a book and he decided to buy and when he saw that it will take 4 to 7 days, he bacame anger and said that he hates this and cancelled, but I told him to buy and told that no worry it will not take much time to deliver how much it's showing to us, then he became happy. So I hope amazon will improve this and will not take longer time to deliver products\",POSITIVE\r\n",

Com, Flipkart, Paytm mall, eBay and even gadgets 360 almost for last 4-5 years. Now from last I have been started using Amazon.com by watching various deals and advertisement from various websites. Till now I almost ordered items which is 1 bagpack, 1 jeans, 3 shirts, 1 watch and 1 basic headphone. But I haven't impressed with Amazon.com for some reasons. So I want share my reasons with you guys. So lets start with thing which I impressed.Good things about Amazon.com1) Various offer shopping with Indusind Bank card which is.2) Few segment collections are good like watches, clothing etc.Bad things about Amazon.com1) Delivery is too slow. The fastest delivery I get is 7 days. I am living in kolkata but still too slow delivery. The other e-commerce site I use delivered some items within 3-4 days. If anyome living outside metropolitan city I don't know what is the delivery time for them.2) Price too much high on maximum items. I have compared the price with other e-commerce sites, they are selling at lower cost than Amazon.com .Few product quality is not adequate. My few friends also complained about the quality of product from Amazon.com specially cloths and wearing items.So think before visit and buy anything from Amazon.com and thanks for read my review.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "248,I ordered stadum tempered glass for Asus Zenfone selfie from Amazon on 11 March 2017.order I'd is 40342407031960369.the price of the product was Rs 199 and shipping charges were 65.the grand total 264.i make my payment through online mode.Today I will give review of the Amazon based on my experience.as I told above I ordered it on 11th of march 2017.expected delivery was 23rd of march but it was delivered on 15th of April.that means it take Amazon one month and four days to deliver the product.so you can think the delivery speed of Amazon instead I make the pre payment.it was my first and last deal with amazon.this was my worst experience with Amazon.after that I didnt even think about Amazon.,NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "249,\"Amazon is one of the best online shopping sites. It is one among the few which you can trust. I have been using it for past 3 years and till now my experience with amazon has been great.First of all taking about the layout and arrangement of the products, it is very comprehensive and simple. We can easily pick the item from the specific item types. The selection and availability of items is also good.I have bought about 10 to 15 items till now and most of them were good and satisfactory except one or two delivary issues. The items I received were well packed and of good quality.The delivary service is above average. One or two improvements are needed. The items are delivered within the mentioned time or even earlier. I had about one or two intance of delivary issues. I live in a hostel and I have classes during morning hours. And sometimes the delivary personal reaches the hostel during the class hours, so when he calls me I won't be able to atyend the phone. He won't make any further calls and just deliver the item to someone in the hostel. Once it took me a lot of time to search for the person to whom the delivary person had given the item. The plus point regarding delivary service of amazon is delivary to remote areas is also available through post.Next taking about the customer support. The customer support is excellent. I once placed an item during festive sale and there was an offer usong sbi debit card. I placed the order but I didn't receive the cashback. So I contacted the customer service and they clarified the doubts about the issue very well.Few of the cons I have noticed are.First issue as mentioned above is the delivary team giving the item to someone in the locality in hostel areas.The exchange time is also less. Initially it was 30 days. At present it is 10 days. So when we buy an electrical gadget like a mobile, and if the item gets defective few days after 10 days, we cannot exchange it.The cashback provided during festive sale takes 90 days to get credited into the account. It is very long compared to other online sites.Overall Amazon is a reliable online shopping site.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

So I filled complain to customer executive of amazon. I described all thing. Few day later the customer executive called me to say your ordered could not delivered you.

      "286,\"Hello friends I am sharing my real experience with proof attached screen short for your ready reference, The customer service is worst because even after mails and calls no proper reply for my commission amounts. I think the product qualities are generally good and if we found its not good we have a options for return and exchange based on the product so its a good law to have in our country other wise this type of company have looted us. Delivery is not bad because generally the courier we get it in a time if not 1 day here and there but eventually we get it in a time, They offer quick delivery options by taking an extra cost from its customers. What can I say about app and websites, Generally I can say its nothing but scam because as you can see in my attachments the amazon has an agreement to pay me if any of my referrals buy products but as you can see even after 3 months I did not received or updated any amount in the amazon affiliate marketing site so its nothing but scam and I appeal not to buy any product from this site and I started using flip kart which is way better than Amazon. I will never recommend this to any one because its nothing but they refused to pay my commission for my hard work.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

On 21st November I was super excited and stayed at the home all day. However the package did not arrived, they showed that the package is out for delivery however when u calles the delivery company they said they even did not receive the package.I waited for one more day still the package did not come. I was quite very sad that my shades were quite very late. However whenever I tried to contact their costumer service or the delivery company they always disconnected my call. The worst part was after 4 more days they were showing product delivered however I didn't receive anything. I did not receive any reply of my emails and questions. Finally I had to cancel the order and place the order on another site.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "312,\"I have a very bad experience with the snapdeal.com . I ordered a necklace from snapdeal.com . It makes me fool. When I opened the box, the box was empty.  I was totally shocked.  I used to talk with customer service  but they did not respond me very well. I mailed the customer service but no one respond me . The quality of products provided by the snapdeal.com is very poor. Its binding quality is very poor. The delivery time taken by the snapdeal.com  is more. It doesn't deliver the product at the right time. The app provided by the snapdeal.com is very  bad . There are many bug which slow your phone . The website work very slow even in high speed net. I can not trust on this online shopping store because it makes me fool. The snapdeal.com did not send my money back of necklace. This is not reliable. This is fraud.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "313,\"Hello guys I am Jayant , in this review I am going to share my experience about snapdeal.com .One month ago I ordered a bag from snapdeal.com the description of the bag was as follows, it was a lapaya company bag, it was really looking nice bag made with polyester with capacity to carry laptop and the price of the bag was 550, I was very excited for the delivery.Finally the date arrived and I got the package when I opened it, I was shocked they send me a low quality bag that was made by nylon and the company symbol wasn't there , it was the worst quality bag, I didn't get what I saw in picture and in the description box of that bag and price of that bag should be 150 which they sent me , I was very disappointed and decided to return that bags and asking for refund.I instantly applied for the return and refund, after that within 7 days they sent me a delivery boy to pick the bag with the invoice and cover after pick up they took one month to refund my money in my bank account .Although it was a bad experience but this is the positive thing that they refund my moneyI think they should taking care of their customers and how to full fill Desire of a customer and send the right/exact product which appear and explained in the description box and pictures.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "314,\"Hello guys, there are so many reason why I should not prefer you shopping from snapdeal.com 1, the product is not exactly which you have bought.Like I ordered 1 pair of shoes from snapdeal at that time there are so many photos of that shoes that I can easily check the quality but the truth revealed when it delivered to me. The shoes were like some already used it before me. It is dirty looking like old.2, There customer support is very bad like for returning those shoes I call to customer care and I told them that the shoes which I have received is already used by some one and I want to refund my money. so they told me that sir that's not our fault you should check on the spot after delivery and after so many requests and phone calls they got agreed to refund my money and it took 23 days for refunding my money.3, too costly items as compared to the market price Like in urgent I need a pendrive of maxium storage of 50 gb so I was searching online for 64gb pendrive on snapdeal.they were charging 2069 rupees for a 64gb pendrive at that time I really need it so without wasting my time I bought it but after some days I went to palika bazar and at there a boy who selling that same pendrive which I bought just few days back. I asked the price and I was shocked. He was giving me that pendrive in 1150 only. At that time I feel very regret\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "340,\"I have bought a Ray-Ban Green aviator Sunglasses from snapdeal last month. Received product was lokeing almost okay, but the plastic part of the leg was loose and that made me suspicious . Upon closer inspection, I have found that there is a spelling mistake on the leg, it was printed as AVATOR instead of AVIATOR. It can happen only on a fake item. Secondly seller shipped RB3026 instead of RB3025 which is larger varinent. Fortunately, I boutght this item to gift it to someone, so I didn't remove any seal or sticker of the product or accessories. So when I have reported these issues to SnapDeal, they have verified and accepted the return and took the item back. But after few days, they came back saying that the item passes their QC and it is a genuine item so I will have to accept it. The email looks like from a template rather than someone actually written it with manual effort. I was shocked with the response and send the marco photograph which shows the spelling mistake and the video I have captured initially as a proof. After few days, they send me back the same templated reply which I had received earlier. Either they are not verifying the proof which I had sent using some kinds of automated replys to consumers. I can totally frustrated with  the snapdeal support team and will never order any product from them. Also I am not going to accept the fake item, So I have raised a dispute through my credit card processor and waiting for their response seller. I will never use snapdeal again and not recommended for any one else. Best regards. Sivakumar. M\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

The packaging of the phone was average. The customer care was not supportive when I was asked about why courier boy not coming to my village and asking me to came to the city to pick up my courier package. The product quality was also very poor after five days I found the mobile was defective so return it. he process to receive my money back is too bad. The Sanpdeal app is good to analyze the products.

On 03/09/2017 I ordered a pair of nike shoes and it got delivered on 10/09/2017 and after few day's of running I am seeing that the label on the tounge of the shoe is removing by itself, then I realised that this may be a fake product and I am seeing that the box had a different model name and also the barcode on the tounge of the shoe didn't match with the barcode of the box, after that I was realised that I am scammed online for fake product and this is the most horrible thing I have seen in my life .It is making me untrustable to online shooping .\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "398,\"So I want to share my experience with all of you. Snapdeal really good online store bcoz I have bought many products which are cheaper and good than Amazon and Flipkart example when I'm finding speakers for my laptop then I like f&d v520 laptop speaker so I compare price with Amazon and Flipkart then I found that snapdeal have cheaper price than both of them and another example when I need a memory card and I found Samsung class 10 Evo memory card so that time I found it cheaper then amazon and Flipkart that's why I like this store and it will deliver product in 3 to 4 working days that's ok because it depends on the product availability near your home that's all. According to their mobile app and website both are good and responsive, I didn't face any problem and product delivery always good and authentic. That's all I experienced and that's why I like it.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "399,I had pain in my back .so I searched online on snapdeal and ordered a massager.

They disappoint me.,NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "403,\"I am experiencing really bad service from snapdeal. I am not satisfied with the ordered product from snapdeal which is ( Sony blutooth speaker) . But snapdeal clearly said that they will not return any electronic product now. here is my concern Why so? if I am getting a defective/not working product, why it can not be returned by snapdeal. other online sites provide easy returns than snapdeal. so what is the use of purchasing any item from snapdeal, if this kind of service they are providing to their customers. Also there is no direct option to connect to there customer support desk, there is only one contact number which is: 9212692126, but on this number also there is no way you can discuss or share your problem. I am highly dissatisfied with its service. and would not refer anyone to prefer snapdeal for any shopping. thank youo\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "405,Before few days I ordered a full set of Brother BT5000 Ink for my Brother Dcp T300 all in one printer. I assured me to give a genuine ink. After Delivery I used this ink on my printer for. After 7 days of using My printer stopped working. I called to brother service and they came in my house. after serving they told that this ink is totaly duplicate Brother BT5000 ink. I have to changed my printer head for using this duplicate ink. It was a big fraud from like Snapdeal. I contacted with snapdeal about this issue but they didn't here my views. Its customers service is like worst. Snapdeal has no troll free number and they charged a high amount for calling them. That's not a user friendly customer service. Its App version is very slow and not useful. So friends I want to tell you before shopping from Snapdeal please check the products details carefully. That's my opinion.,POSITIVE\r\n",

      "410,Hi friends I am Shivam from New Delhi and today I am going to share with you a real incident that happened with me: -About one month ago I ordered Philips laptop speakers from snapdeal because my speakers were too old and were not working. I ordered them at RS 1799 from snapdeal and made an online payment while ordering them because on making early online payment they were making an offer to deliver the speakers on the next day itself without charging any delivery charges. But later I found the exact same speakers on another website at just RS 1399. So obviously I cancelled the order from snapdeal and ordered those speakers from that website. But even 3 days later I didn't got my refund back from snapdeal. So I tried contacting the customer care center of snapdeal and they told me that you will receive the refund by tomorrow. But even 2 days later I didn't received my refund and then again I contacted the customer care center but they again told me that I will get the refund tomorrow. This time I was totally frustrated and after waiting for 2-3 more days I again contacted the customer care center and this time I scolded them and told them to make my refund back. Then one more week passed away but even then I did not got my refund of RS 1799 back . Then I decided to forget that issue and about one month later I finally got my refund back.So this is really a very bad service from snapdeal which I never expected from them.Its an example of a very bad customer care service. And what they are showing is that the customer care executives doesn't answer the customers properly and keep ignoring them.So I recommend everyone reading this review to learn from this experience of mine and Never Ever make early online payment for your orders on SNAPDEAL even if you are getting some offers too because it may be possible that they don't even deliver your order to you.Thanks,POSITIVE\r\n",

The Jean appeared totally different from the one I saw on the website. The colour looked faded. The quality of the cloth was not that good. My all money was wasted on such bad Jean. I was very much unsatisfied with the Jean. I didn't return it to the Ajio, instead I gave that Jean to a poor man in my area. I didn't like it but someone else did.

So I called the customer service and told them to replace it as it is not looking original, they said ok we'll take it back but now its over 15 days and no one has come to take the jacket. I called them twice but they said that dont worry we'll take it. I don't know how much time they are gonna take.

But what I thought was wrong when I seen the t-shirts which I received and after using it for 2, 3 times. Slowly the color was vanished and the cloth become so loose and thin which makes me shock. Each of t-shirt costs 600 to 700 which I bought, totally money waste for this kind of quality t-shirts where we can get this kind of quality for very low prices. This is a place where u get low quality attires for such high prices. Big Thumbs Down.!\",POSITIVE\r\n",

Colors are same as shown in the images. Designs are quite impressive. Apart of that, I observed two drawbacks, after washing color is vanishing. It gives a proper look only for few uses. Other Minus is the cost. Even a simple t-shirt price is also very high. I think this is not affordable by all sections of people. And that price is not matching for particular cloth.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

I sent an email and also called them on phone and informed about this return on the same day. Till today(17 aug 2017) the product was not returned to their warehouse and they have not credited back my money. They keep saying that the product has not reached their warehouse. I am wondering why does it take so many days to return a product within Bangalore. If I had to travel from my place to its warehouse it should have taken only an hour or maximum 2 hours.

The customer service was not that good as I did not receive the shoe in estimated time so I called the customer support and they simply manipulated me everytime by altering their answers. Delivery time was way too much. It took almost 15 days to reach the shoe at my home. But the estimated time was 4-6 days. The app and website are designed well and not too much fancy. Both app and website takes some time to load. Hence slow internet might cause some problem to open the website. Overall the website is indeed reliable but still a few things to improve upon such as the customer support and the delivery time. Thanks\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "441,I have placed an order 17 June'17 and on the same day it was confirmed but now after seven days they have cancelled it and saying merchandise don't have this product. I got to know this information after I sent mail to them regarding my product otherwise nobody is going to take pain to tell me. Such a bad experience. What type of services are you serving?. how can you take money from customer without getting confirmation from merchandise? Really disappointed. This was my first order and experience was very bad #ajio #ajiolife #badservice #disappointed,NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "442,Hello friends Today I want to share my personal opinon on ajio shooping. Basically it is a cloth product selling site but it also sells some reliance products. One such product is jiofi . I ordered jiofi 2 months ago. I came but when I opened it the back cover was slightly broken. It was annoying but ok. After a week jiofi started showing red signal on the network part. I saw other smartphones with jio sim the signal was full. It was my first time on ajio and my father was angry on me . I saw it on many shops but no solution. After one month I suddenly reseted jiofi and the signal came. My experince was not good I do not prefer you to use This site.,POSITIVE\r\n",

      "444,\"Hello friends, I share my experience on the most trustable fashion website AJIO.com which is founded by The great businees man Mr Mukesh Dhirubhai Amabani & Nita Ambani in 1st april, 2016 now a days this is the biggest online fashion store.Ajio is mainly Indian ecommerce fashion company.If you buy any fashionable product from this website I tell you the product is genuine I and my other friends also use it.They delivery your things in very short time, the communication with customer is also good.For this reason this website love by cuatomers.I suggest you buy any fashionable products beacuse its have huge stock and the product is genuine.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "446,\"Ordered twice both times orders were cancelled after few days saying out of stock, really I am very upset. Their coupons code does not work. They don`t even show if its expired. If you seriously don`t wanna user apply coupons that why don`t you remove it. Very late process, worst customer support brand copy collection, used product and quality of the products are very cheap. I will never go with ajio store. Had stored some items in the bag and now the bag or the cart is showing empty. There no section where I can leave my feedback about the store, really I am very disappointed very bad experience with ajio store.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "447,\"Recently near about 28th of may I ordered 2 watches from this site. The images I saw of the watches on this site were too adorable, and the price was reasonable, so I ordered it, they showed the expected date of delivery after 8 days which I thought was more than expected(but later I recieved it 5 days after order) . Now about the products delivered to me, the watches were not looked fresh, secondly one watch was not assembled properly which later I got assembled from market. so I have no more belief on this site. its my personal view.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "448,Recently I used AJIO online shopping and here is my review on it. Customer service : I had ordered a intex home theatre from AJIO and when I used it at first time I found a defect in one of the speaker and then I called it's customer service. I told them about the defect but the customer executive denied about the fact that the speaker is defective. They didn't proceed with my complain and refused to exchange the product. Product quality : As I told you about my defective speaker so now you can guess what type of quality they are providing. Delivery timelines : They claim to deliver the product within 5-6 days but they delivered my product within just 3 days which is very good. App & websites : The app and websites of AJIO is not common nor they are very much famous so they should promote it so that large number of people can use it. Reliability : This shopping website is not reliable because of their executives behaviour and poor quality products. I will not recommend this website,POSITIVE\r\n",

I kept awake till midnight for the phn and what I get in return NOTHING The page is stuck on that screen there was no flash sale and the same when I check this morning Iam early riser so I sleep early, website mistake had kept me awake for nothing.

      "452,\"I use this site when I want daily need items. We get so many cashbacks on This site on so many daily need items be it snacks, shampoos, home needs and many more. But the wrong thin I get of the site is its quality of giving you the actual products. If I search for all out ultra mmosquito repellent it shows me results of a totally difeerent item and this is the problem while we try to search a particular item or anything in common.This wastes a lot of time on this site. We have to select the category and then browse the total products to find what we want .Now this is the biggest drawback.Also the cashback is credited after 20-24 houes of the item being shipped , this should be changed. Then many a times there are connection errors on the site , many items are out of stock for months .so overall its a waste of time , yes those who have free time can spend hours here. Customer service is not good at all , firstly thr number is not toll free and then the computer controlled customer care takes lot of time.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

Also, you guys might be running on such a poor and back obsolete technology as I have sent 3 times,you getting that its three times I have sent you guys with the pictures of my product,post that what reply I am getting from side is that you have not shared any pictures with us till now. I am sending from my registered email id them how come its not showing you over there,this is not my issue that my sent mail is not showing in your system might be you guys just need to upgrade your systems. When I called a few days back I don't remember the exact date as I have a life and job and other things to do as well unlike you guys,so some girl took my call and she was so lame an untrained that she was not able to assist me and hence ended up by disconnecting my call. Shall I consider this that she was not having any answers or you guys are in the top list of Frauds.! So, lets move on to another and very interesting phase of this story. So when I called you guys up yesterday as it's quite obvious as it's my hard earn money so I have to. So the so called executives and ur programmed seniors who were just repeating one statement only like they were programmed to act like that, told me that they are investigating! oh hell you are kidding me its been ove r two weeks even I took a screenshot of my mail where its showing me that the mail was sent to you guys but again the representative asked me to upload these images on your site. You guys really think so that I have that much time to do these things just because of your failure. After all you have sent me the single quantity wherein I ordered for 2, and the one which I have received with that too is totally CRUSHED and I have already shared the condition of that cap to you guys. I mean it's your fault and why I am suffering because of your fault, you just have check with your warehouse team and the courier team and for this month you guys are taking 2 weeks and still no update from you guys how much patience you can expect from a customer! I am done with my patience level with you guys. All the representatives to whom I had a word with all were useless and were even not able to form a sentence properly over the call and you guys have put them to your escalation desk are you guys insane or you guys are hiring school drop outs in your escalation team. all those 4 guys SHUBHAM,PANKAJ,ARYAN & KARTIK were totally dumb. well I am pissed off totally with you guys & I am just hoping for a quick response.

After placing an order I have recieved a sms that it would be deliver in 4 working days. But I recieved it after a waiting of 9 days. And the product I have recieved is very poory quality product. It has broken in very first usage. Whenever we put some pressure in the slicer it was broken. I was complained against this situation and they didn't react to the complaint.

I called them and shown them along with proofs, they argued at first and almost after couple of weeks, they exchanged the product but again I got the damaged one with the bottom part which was completely broken. I got irritated with thier product delivery. I again called them and also sent them the video of opening the package after they delivered and the photos of the damaged product within a hour.

      "468,\"I placed an order using Pepper Fry from paper fry studio Thane Mumbai on 3rd June 2017 My order number is 303113848. I made the payment on-line, but I was shocked while talking to the customer relations manager assigned to me Mr. Vinit(Phone No 7506430059) when I asked him to combine the delivery of all the items on one date, the answer I got was you are not the only customer I need to coordinate many others. He did not help me at all the delivery was coming staggered and I had to coordinate with the delivery person. Most important thing is he never use to lift the phone on Saturday and Sunday being his off days. Customer is left on the mercy of god. One of the item which was showing delivery date as 12th June is not yet delivered and online there is no update. Another product which was delivered and is defective I tried through various platforms like contacting the studio person(who booked my order Mr. Kannan Nair Phone no:8286919346) beside I am accelerating the complaint no other reply from this gentleman as on date. More over for defective part the answer was you have to talk to customer support on 022-61576157 which is useless no and guys over there are trained like parrot they talk only sorry sir, I apologise, you will hear soon our senior will be in touch with you within 24 to 48 hours and no one contact you. On asking phone no of studio incharge his reply was I need to talk to her? on landline no he gave 022 60121121 which even after trying “N” no of times there was no response for nearly 10 times I called. Following are my details of contacting customer care on 61576157- 31/7/2017 talked with Mr. Pratik and he assured to resolve the complaint within day or two and no response. On 2/8/2018 registered complaint on official site of paper fry and called on 6157 6157 on 3/8/2017 talked to Mr. Akshat as per him they received my complaint through e-mail there senior Mr. Yash will call me within 24 to 48 hours(On requesting Mr. Yash’s number they don’t give you the number either) As there was no response till 7/08/2017 I again called on favorite no 6157 6157 and talked to Mr. Vilal and was surprised to know from him that Mr. Yash has already talked to you it is mentioned in the system. When I said no one contacted me he said he will call you today or tomorrow. As off now no one contacted me. I am totally fed up of dealing with these guys. Just a suggestion to all those who want to buy from paper fry please check the feedback before ordering more over the quality of furniture is not worth the price they charge after huge discount. Last but not the least there is saying “You can fool one person all the time, you can fool some people for some time but you cannot fool all the people for all the time” this perfectly applies to pepper fry. In present era of digitization people have lot of good alternatives. Please Don’t buy products from pepper fry!. Being an e-commerce company in these times, their service is extremely lousy. There is complete lack of communication with the customer and within the organization itself. Your money goes into a black hole and any amount of follow-up has no effect on them. With the fundamentals of business completely missing in this company and its employees, I strongly advise people not to waste their time, money, trust and patience on Pepper fry, lest you be fried till your wit’s end!\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "470,\"Hi, I have ordered a sofa from Pepperfry at 24999 rs. In a week I got my sofa and I was very happy as in first glance it was looking very beautiful. So what happened was after a month I saw that there are termites in certain area of the woods so I called the customer service and told about termites in the wood and I said that I want to return this product and want a new one but they said that according to our police we can only return or exchange product within 7 days. I was shocked and said how can I judge a product within 7 days when its a furniture but they didn't exchange my product and said we can only repair it.So as per me the policy of returning a product is very less and they should change it to at least for a month. If I talk about other things like delivery time and app its good enough but other things like reliability or customer service they need to work on this. So at last I would like to say that if you are buying any furniture from Pepperfry do all the checks properly form wood to fabric.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "473,Dear FriendsI am fond of shopping online and just want to tell you that I opened a mounted chair from this site which was looking very attractive.The intrerface of the site was slow but somehow I ordered it.It was of rs5000.Now the first thing is that it takes a time duration of a month to deliver it to my home.When I just call them inbetween this period they just say will be deliverd after two days.So when I just saw first time chair in package I was shocked since it was not properly wrapped.I was disappointed.Now when I just opens it the color of the chair was totally fade and was not shining like shown on site.I think that they made me fool which enrages anger in me.When I just started using the table I was shocked because the chair got defect within a month and now the chair is not rotating.Their customer service is also worst since when I complaint then no reply was their from that sideReally disappointedThanks for reading my review,NEGATIVE\r\n",

I almost pleaded as my nephew have exam after a week and he needed chair and table for studies but they were adamant with their policy. They were quite insensitive to my problem which I don't like.

Secondly, it is not at relaible as they took 20 days to deliver my order and when I contacted them, they used to say that my product will be delivered in 2-3 days but they took 20 days and that too a cheap quality work. So I would not recommend anyone to use Pepperfry.com\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "476,\"Pepperfry.com is a very expensive site. I ordered a normal king size bed for Rs. 60, 000 and when it was delivered it had poor packaging and the delivery men didn't even assemble my bed, I had to do it for myself. After a month I saw the same bed in one the retail shops for Rs. 26000 . The quality was even better. So the furniture that this site provides is expensive and the material quality is not that good. Finishing is also not up to the mark. For the price range this site is providing, you can get premium quality furniture from nearby retail stores or even you get your furniture custom made for lower price. So I suggest you not to buy furniture from this site. Thank you.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "477,I had ordered two products from PepperFry after visiting their experience centers. After waiting for more than 2 weeks they informed me that one of the products has reached their warehouse in damaged condition and they cannot arrange a replacement so they are cancelling the product and will refund the money They came to deliver the other product. But when I unpacked it I found that it was completely a different product from the one that I had ordered. Thankfully I had unpacked in front of the delivery person. So I did not accept the product. The next day I get an email saying that a wrong product was sent. Now the product that I had chosen is discontinued and they cannot deliver the same. So they wanted me to select another product of the same price or lesser. I have asked to cancel and refund the money. The discontinued product is still displayed at their experience stores.

      "478,\"Recently I bought Sofa set(through order no- 303456331) furniture from Pepperfry without know the fact that this would invite worst nightmarish buying experience. Out of the two Sofa set bought, one was in damaged condition and delivery boy took away the furniture with assurance that it will be delivered again within a week time. They took back the furniture on 15th October 2017, and since then inspite of my numerous follow up with customer care swpnil I have not received my furniture. I was assigned customer care executive named, Mr Swapnil. I have tried to reach him almost daily but he has never appeared on phone and every time an assurance is given to me that a call back from Swapnil would be arranged. I have not received even a single call from Pepperfry staff. I have written mail also to pepperfy but there is no revert. Then I even approached Pepperfry studion at Indirapuram, Ghaziabad branch and met Ms Deepa. She had clear answer, we can not help you as this is not our affair. They are simply into fraudulent business and once you make the payment, they are not at all approachable. I would never recommend shopping from this company. Stay away from this company. I hope some one should call me through this post. Anup Verma\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "480,I had purchased a office chair on 29th Aug on pepperfry.com and order id is 303336246. Till date the status is showing as in transit with date of 12th Sep to 26th Sep. No delivery or updates on the site after 26th Sep. Multiple calls to customer support of pepperfry.com has not been informative as they are clueless on where the product is and reluctant to refund the money paid. This is for awareness of other potential customers not to fall into this trap. pepperfry.com keeps saying that Nilkamal is responsible for delivering this. If pepperfry.com has no responsibility and accountability then why they accepted payment for the product. So much for quality service! Save yourself of multiple calls everyday for a office chair!,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "481,\"I ordered one bed in peppery fry worth of 37, 500 rs. they delivery my bed after 15 days. The important thing is they don't delivery the product to my home they call me and ask to come and collect the product . the reason they said is they are unable to find my location how silly answer is this I usually buy all products in online itself all products will deliver at my door itself but this pepperfry team doesn't find my location finally I collected my product. I just complaint to the customer service they also not respond well. the product quality also not worth to money. this is the waste website to buy furniture because they don't deliver properly.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

I ordered XXXL Bean bag with and round footstool on 6th of Aug and they deliver me on 15th of Aug, the shipment is a little late however when I got the delivery I want amazed to see the quality of the product . The Bean bag is quite big compared to others and the quality of the product is very good . My first impression about delivery time is bad but when I see the quality its amazing. But I can guaranteed you when u buy the product u've gonna love the product . The App / Website is user friendly you can operate easily. If you find any defect in this product you can approach to customer service who will take care of all your queries. But one thing is for sure you gonna love the quality of this product.

      "483,\"In July I bought this product offered by Pepperfry, a Stockton Single Bed in Provincial Teak Finish by Woodsworth for Rs.24132/- [after discount it came down to approx 19k]. The design was simple and elegant and so was the color and hence I was pleased with myself for having made a good purchase! from a brand ike Pepperfry. It was for my guest room and so was not going to be used regularly. BUT imagine MY SHOCK when last week .just 2 months since I purchased this product.the bed just fell apart at the headboard! and it was never even used to date! I then called Pepperfry to lodge a complaint. The cust svc exec sent me a email so that I could upload pics and then she promised that the \"\"case is being forwarded to another department\"\" and I will get a call from Gayatri. since then 3 days passed and no calls or any text message or updates from Pepperfry. So I called them again a 2nd time. [so annoying to have a wait time of 2 mins!] and again explained my case etc etc . and again they gave me the \"\"standard spiel of apologies\"\" and that \"\"my case is being forwarded to the concerned department\"\"! and yet another day passed and no calls or any update from them! So AGAIN I called them today . really annoying to wait through the IVR and finally reach a cust svc exec who YET AGAIN spits out her \"\"standard spiel of apologies\"\" and YET AGAIN tells me that \"\"my case is being forwarded to the concerned department\"\"! so I waited patiently and asked her to connect me to a Manager or supervisor. The waiting time was 10 MINUTES! one can imagine how furious I was! FINALLY a lady comes on line [I did not bother to ask her designation as she sounded just like another exec] and YET AGAIN the \"\"same standard spiel of apologies\"\"! they now have promised to send a replacement headboard within the next 15-20 days and I hope I do receive it! I had to ask them to follow up and keep me updated and also make an effort to deliver it to me within 10 days. atleast this way I can be sure that they \"\"REALLY ARE APOLOGETIC\"\"! But my verdict here is PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE, PATHETIC AFTER SALES SERVICE AND SUPER PATHETIC QUALITY OF FURNITURE! NO WONDER THEY ARE OFFERING AT HUGE DISCOUNTS.ITS TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT!\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "484,\"Today I am writing review about Pepperfry.com . I used this website for online furniture shopping. I have ordered a collage photo frame. But after I received the photo frame I got to know a key information that the photos in the photo frame cannot be changed. We need to stick the photos. This key information was not present in the website. When asked for a refund, they did not do it. The team of Pepperfry is just not interested in serving their customers or even bothered to get back again . I kept calling the executives but I had no on responding well to me . Prices are very high compared to other websites. I don't think so its making any sense here . I would not recommend anyone to go with Pepperfry.com\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "485,\"I recently bought a kind size bed after visiting pepperfry studio here in hyderabad. The bed got delivered after 12 days ( -1 star for such a late delivery) but yeah they did compensate with excellent quality and professionalism. The delivery folks checked each amd every item for signs wear and tear due to transportation. I was really happy to see them verifying each and every detail post delivery. They helped with getting the carpentar assigned for the assembly. The bed was assembled the same day it was delivered. One small suggestion to pepperfry team. Please keep only those items in your studio which are available in stock and not the out of stock ones. Overall shopping experience was good with Pepperfry. I did feel that the price was mostly on the higher side but with the quality that was delivered to us, they surely impressed us.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

When I entered the pin code of my delivery location, it was showing that products will be delivered by 13th-14th July. After adding those products into the cart, I made the payment on-line, but I was shocked as soon as payment was done. Because it was showing the completely different delivery dates(04-August-2017). I was really into pressure as my parents are supposed to come by 15th July, and I have placed the order, so that product is delivered before they come here. I called the customer care in the morning but I haven't got any response. Then I twitted about my problem using #Fraud, and I got the initial response after an hour around. Then she said, she won’t cancel the order, if I use the fraud term again. I said ok don’t repeat the things. She was literally threatening me that she won’t cancel the order and I can do whatever I can. After that she disconnected the call. Please don't buy products from them there, they are all fraud.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "493,\"I bought a mattress from pepperfry.com. Firstly, very late delivery. I ordered the mattress on 3rd April 2017, however the mattress was delivered on 19-April-2017. Secondly, misguided return and refund policy. On the home page of their website, they write that they offer a 7-Day Easy Return window. I wanted to return the product, as mistakenly I ordered the wrong size mattress. I require 72X35 inch, however I ordered 72X30 inch. Pepperfry refused to take the mattress back and refund my amount. Even they are not ready to replace it with 72X35 size available on Pepperfry. I have not even unpacked the mattress.  On calling they are saying, there are terms and conditions for return and we can not return it.

But here went the drama. It was 29th and it was not yet delivered. Most of the times you have to prepay in Pepperfry. Even mine was same case. I called them and asked to track my order. Believe me. There is no real time tracking. Customer executive said only lorry driver knows where product is. First of all I waited 4 days for shipment itself. The demerits are, You have to prepay, no real time tracking, Zero on time delivery, etc. Atlast I got my product on Jan 30th! Thank god! I have never seen a  website, who takes 2 weeks to deliver to central Bangalore. Believe me, One of my order in Flipkart got delivered on same day, I returned next day and refund was also complete.

      "514,\"Dressing table- I purchased recently. It is made out of engineered wood. ( particle board) . Took 10 days to deliver, infact they delivered earlier than promised which was two week during booking . They will call us to confirm the availability. Delivery team  is flexible. They will try to deliver at the time we ask them for ( wherever possible) . Within a day their carpenter will call for comleting the assembly. Again this team is flexible. You can tie up with them at your convenience. They will not mess up the place after assembly work. However disposal of package material is our responsibility. They will talk very nice. Carpenters are decent but they expect some tip. They never ask explicitly, but their body language  says it all. Pepperfry show ads on tv where carpenters say no to tip. So I didnt pay them any tip. Without a tip they go bit disappointing which clearly can be seen with the way they talk before leaving. As far as I believe no need to tip them. Coming to product, it is decent. Can say good for the money I paid  ( new users get discount ) .  without discount prices seems higher. Look for coupons. HDFC30 - u get 30% off on credit card payments. overall I can give 4 for product and service. Warranty I have to see how they will support.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

To my huge surprise, I received a call from pepperfry executive saying that, they cannot take the return request even if I am not satisfied with the quality of the product by given some excuses. This is pure evil thing, now I am stuck with the product with low quality. For unsuspecting customers like me, this is not acceptable. If customer is not happy with the product then they should accept the return for the same. I would request other customers not to order things from'Pepperfry' evil website as they don't accept returns for their own delivered products, which makes me wonder all the marketing money spend by them is just to fool the people around in buying stuff for which they will not accept any returns. I am going to file a case with consumer forum regarding the same as this is as intricate as it can get. There was no info mentioned on the product that this is non-returnable item. I am bewildered by their marketing gimmick. Their voracious demand for business by fooling customer is making them stoop so low, which is new record on its own. I really hope some sense will prevail in them after this review. I am going to take this matter to the end. Also, don't go by the other ratings and feedback, few of them might be fake and purchased. It's a horrible website and purchase should be done on own risk. Anant.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

However, with deep regret I have to mention that till date no body from the concerned department in Pepperfry has reached out to me. I have also sent E-Mails addressing my concerns. The only reply that I have been getting since 23rd October is – somebody from the concerned department would get back to me within 24 hours. And I have received 01007963 and 01008678 as complain numbers. However, it is more than 7 days from the date of rejection from my end and I have not received any resolution to my issue nor do I see any efforts from their end. I have only received commitments from their end, both in mails and verbally which they have not kept. I am extremely dis-satisfied with their service. I have invested my hard earned money and I feel as if I have been cheated. I still have not received the table and I cannot invest in another table from a different supplier because my money is stuck up with Pepperfry. This adds up to my frustration and harassment. As a responsible citizen, I will leave no stones unturned to spread awareness amongst fellow citizens and my near and dear ones regarding my experience with Pepperfry which is pathetic.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "518,\"I recently bought an entertainment unit from this site. It is a solidwood wall unit from Hometown. I had it saved in the wishlist for the past few weeks. Its retail price was close to 45, 000 so I was waiting for a sale. Saw it available at half the retail price, flat 50% off and instantly placed the order. The estimated delivery was within 3 weeks, which makes sense since it is a piece of furniture. Since the amount was quite high, I didn't get any cash on delivery option, anyways I made an online payment. Process is similar to other sites. Got email and sms as well. No complains there. The furniture arrived and it looks amazing, so elegant and has completely changed the look of the living room. Wonderdul experience, I really hope they keep up with the good work and don't stop giving discounts.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "519,\"I brought a bookrack from pepperfry.com, I heard about this from a friend who recommended me about this.so I instantly clicked on it, they have variety of beautiful furniture both wooden and glasses some of them imported from aboard.All are of exquisite designs and its really hard to chose from them one piece. Its been 5 months I have using it and the wooden bookrack has still same  shine as purchased.I am planning to get another centre table for my drawing room and a separate sofa set, which I alreasy selected from the site.All the items are at s great affordable prices.So far loving it .I am  definitely recommending this site to my friends and colleagues.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "520,\"I placed order for several items for my new house including one Gas Stove. It took several weeks to send these items one by one. That delayed my shifting by almost a month. I could have bought all these items from nearby market or mall on same day in almost same price but discount on registration disillusioned me in trap. I regret that. To add to my misery Pepperfry refused to return the Gas stove. We wanted Silver but got Black. I failed to notice that while ordering since the product description had just “BK”. I offered to pay more for silver colored but no luck. Unlike other online sites, Pepperfry doesn’t return unless its damaged.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "521,\"I ordered a queen size and side table from Pepperfry. This company delivered defective piece, claiming that a proper QC has been done and taking more than 7 days to action on the complaint that was initiated at the time of assembly. They make the customers fool by assuring false commitments which they never care. No one from refund department has ever called me till date whenever I call them, it seems that everyone in the refunds are busy as if they are doing so much good to their customer. You deliver a defective item and taking your own sweet time to resolve the complaint and now you are offering 30% of cash back. Should it be acceptable. Refund the amount immediately and get both the items on this order away from my place. Refund the amount immediately and get both the items on this order away from my place. You committed for a call back which was never done inspite of calling you everyday. You did false promise that the carpenter is assigned and would visit to inspect. Your defective piece and packing materials are blocking my space and nothing have been done so far. Only false commitment of carpenter being assigned and call back. Pathetic service.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "522,\"I recently placed an order, based on picture on website . but product was very small in size and very shiny which is not my taste. when place return request, they mentioned that our policy has changed . we can not return on this condition.

      "523,\"Bought Yuko Queen Size Bed and mattress(as recommended by pepperfry), must admit I was apprehensive about the quality after reading many negative reviews about the pepperfry later on till prouducts got delivered. So here is my experience for the bed, quality of wood, make and finish is excellent far better than I had expected for the price. Delivery was on time. Carpenter was deputed by them only and staff was really professional. It was all such a smooth experience overall . Same day it was assembled also within 2 hours of delivery of the products. If I compare it with local market furnitures quality is far more better and service is absolutely hassle free.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "524,\"I had placed an order #303565626. They delivered the table, however the product is not up to mark and I wish to return it. However the returns are extremely painful. Their customer care is not reachable. Please think 100 times before ordering from them. They do not have cash on delivery. Once they deliver the product they do not care whether you like it or no. Pathetic after sales and returns.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "525,\"I ordered two Nilkamal weekender plastic chairs from Pepperfry.com recently. I was assured that the items will be delivered within two weeks. I was constantly updated regarding the status of my order through emails and SMS. I was surprised to receive the product on the 9th day itself. The delivery agent called me before hand to check if I was available at my home. Two people arrived, one had the delivery logs and retail invoice while the other one was a helper.The helper unpacked my chairs with care and even took away the packaging(bubble wraps) when I asked him to do so. The senior guy was very polite and courteous. They delivered and unpacked the order with zero dirt and wastage. I had previously ordered a set of 5 polyster cushions and two 18W LED bulbs from their website too. I received both the products before the estimated date and in very good quality packaging. The bulbs are working just fine and the cushions are of good quality. As a gesture of thanks, Pepperfry.com also sent me a box of scented candles as a gift. All in all, I had a great experience with Pepperfry.com and would surely buy from their website again.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "526,\"I ordered two mats. supposed to arrive by 27 Oct(Order No. 303433222) but they did not show up. I had to call and chase, and the Pepperfry system did not know they were not delivered. Then they spent another 10 days not knowing where the mats have gone. Meanwhile, they kept calling my old telephone number, which I have changed already on their record. Everytime the agent was different. No one was trying to help me solve the issue. FINALLY, I asked for a refund. They agreed after another few days. But when I told them because the PayTM telephone number has been changed, they should not refund to my old telephone number, they said they cannot do anything. THIS IS CRAZY. Pepperfry's choice of products are of quality, but their CUSTOMER SERVICE is really bad when trouble happens. I don't even know if I will get the money I pay for now. It is sooo much work to get back what I deserve\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "527,\"This is in regards to Pepperfry Order # 303532355-HC1511027-S-PM18480, As I received a damaged product, I asked for return. Fist of all, they did not reply back to my query. After repeated call, they final responded with apology. What they had come up with was quite surprising. They told that they wouldn't receive it, rather I have to contact the manufacturer company and ask for the replacement. Icing on the cake was, the number they had provided was not reachable.After that neither they picked my call(refund team: The guy was Naresh), nor called me back. They are so unprofessional that they lie to customer. They dont even connect customer to the concerned department. Always shows some excuses, that team is on lunch break, team is not in office. You will feel like hell. They are the worst at return. Once they deliver, they dont care about the customer. The most horrible customer service I have ever experienced. They are so cheap, I have never though of. Kindly be aware of it. Those are Fraud, They just intentionally deliver damaged product. And then they wont let you to reach out to them so that at the end, you would be frustrated, and let it go.Horrible, Pathetic, Ridiculous.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

I am satisfied for the product which I have purchased, but deeply disappointed with the services provided by the Pepperfry, instead that we should for go some other sites.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "531,\"I purchased a wooden shoe rack, product looks intact as shown in the website but material used is poor in quality especially at the backside. Backside wood is so thin that makes the whole product so fragile that it can break into pieces if you bang your hand on it. It gets dis balanced whenever I put any shoe in it. Customer management is equally pathetic as their product quality, they do not bother about customer concerns and closes the ticket without worrying about customer satisfaction.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

The customer service refused to accept the return and then I escalated the issue. 48hours and no one contacted me. 2nd escalation done and some one from customer service called me and was very very rude.

      "537,\"I ORDERED 2 wooden items - 1 book shelf and 1 wall shelf. I was amazed to see that both the products received were in DAMAGED condition. Their PACKAGING was so damn POOR. no wonder items were damaged. Also, the product quality was not upto the mark. Wall Shelf - Material was mentioned as Solid wood on Pepperfry - but it was no where close to Solid.seemed like a low grade wood with poor finish. Book Shelf - Material was mentioned as Mango wood on Pepperfry. Mango wood is known as it is durable and long-lasting and has a unique grain pattern. The product drawers looked so fragile and was broken badly. it was'nt chipping or something. THIS IS THE 3rd TIME I RECEIVED A DAMAGED PRODUCT! For the Book Shelf - return was filed on 22nd sep . Its been 5 days.and I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FROM PEPPERFRY.NO MAIL, NO MESSAGE, NO APP NOTIFICATION, NO CUSTOMER REP CALLS . Nothing.

      "539,\"I purchased a' Yuina Three Door Wardrobe in Wenge Finish by Mintwud' for Rs.10739/-  through pepperfry.com on 08.09.2016 and the item delivered  on 25.09.2016. Even though the wardrobe was looking similar to that in picture its strength was very poor. But I accepted the item only because I meant it only for keeping my clothes. But after six months, from June, 2017 onwards the wardrobe started to infect by mold and fungus, both inside and outside.  Now, after the completion of nine months, wardrobe is not in a usable form. Pepperfry customercare team  is not ready to attend my complaint, they are saying it may be due to a climate change and they cannot offer any help. Pepperfry.com absolutely cheated me by supplying poor quality material. The wardrobe is not in a condition for even a resale and it totally wasting my space, money and energy. I wanted a complete refund of my money and so I filed a complaint in consumerhelpline portal.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "540,\"I had placed on order for a table with Pepperfry. Before placing the order, I called them up to get further details about the finish, quality etc. There answers were convincing and hence placed an online order and paid for it. Order ref # 303244655. When the product arrived, I had to follow up with them to get it fixed. The quality of the product was well below standard, totally different from the details given in the product page and info received from the customer-care. Worst still, the the table top came off, when we tried to move the table by few inches. It is one of the worst quality workmanship. I tried giving an online complaint. The complaint page requires the picture of the item to be uploaded with size upto 1 mb. Even when I tried uploading the picture, which was less than 50KB, their system was not accepting and was displaying error message \"\" pl upload file less than 1 mb\"\", probably due to some bugs. Hence I had called the customercare & also sent a mail to them using Feedback feature. I was also asked to upload the pictures using the feedback option which I did. Pepperfry called back after a day and told me that they will evaluate the return. They sent a carpenter who came and dismantled the damaged table, so that it can be taken back by Pepperfry. It is more than 3 weeks since then and no further action had been taken by Pepperfry either to take back or refund the money. Mails to them remain unanswered. This unresponsiveness of Pepperfry does not augur well, for a large ecommerce company. There seems to be lack of co-ordination / communication gaps between the different agencies. where even after 3 weeks after the carpenter had dismantled the table no action to take it back had been . that too despite reminders. I urge users to be careful while dealing with Pepperfry\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "541,\"I ordered matress pillows queen size bed bedsheets matress cover The smart people in pepperfry delivered pillows, bedsheets and matress cover.

This before making such policies. You just scammed me with sending me half of my order. NEVER BUY FROM PEPPERFRY\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "542,\"Unfortunately, I placed order for Disha round 1.5L easy flow containers on 2nd Spetember. By mistake the address of Pune is selected. I was supposed to select the address of Chandigarh. After few minutes I requested customer care to change the address or to cancel the order but they did not change the address and cancel the order. After my request and mail they ignored all and shipped product on 4th September to Pune. They told me to place the new order parallel to old order. Means money for one order is already stuck with pepperfry and they want me to go for another order. No one is available in Pune address, It was also informed them not to ship as no one is there but still they went for delivery. Then I informed them to deliver the product to neighbor. Till on 14th September the product is not delivered. Even I have not received any call for this concern from the customer care. Very pathetic and disappointing experience. Please do not purchase any product from pepperfry. You can purchase anything from amazon, flipkart blindly. At least your refund will be 100% sure. This pepperfry case is eye opener for all who rely in e- commerce sites. I have used amazon, flipkart, snapdeal, shopclues, paytm, voonik, limeroad, ebay.in. But this is my worst experience ever. If you want to purchase you can go for any of the site blindly. Pepperfry is never ever be recommended by me.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

They sent the Carpenter to inspect the product and he agreed that product is of third grade material. When I contacted them initially that if carpenter says it is not repairable then they will refund me the money. I uploaded the pictures and it is quite clear that the product is of not good quality. After 1-2 days I got a email from the customer care that they cannot refund money because the product has exceeded 7days replacement period. Folks don't be excited with the lucrative offers and discounts which I was trapped with it. This company is a fraud and cheaters. DONT BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM Pepperfry. Com.

Every customer care executive kept giving different reasons and promised they would call back, but nobody did. We called again and again and nothing has come out of it still.

      "546,\"Ordered two straight backed armchairs and a console table. Both products made of cheap and heavy wood.(mango wood?) The joints came apart, upholstery tacks rusted, the table and chairs wobble. I get mail from them asking me to rate the purchases, but there is no way they allow you to post a review. Phone calls get answered after many attempts to call them, and then no follow up. Hiring a carpenter to rectify the problems, is no big deal. The joints can be strengthened with angle joints. The rusty tacks and cheap upholstery can be changed by the upholster down the road. But replacing the cheap wood? . Hahaha. Incidentally my wife and I are the sole occupants of our flat . our children having grown and flown away. So damage cannot possible be ascribed to careless usage.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

The packaging was thorough, actually over packed. Unfortunately the contents were poor quality and you can see that only after opening the packages. Many packages had parts missing. Many of these parts like machine screws and backplates are not easily replaced. When I contacted customer service, I was told they could not do anything because the 7 day window for returns was over. So much for customer service. These guys need to order something from Amazon and understand what good customer service looks like.

They are scammer because. In all my conversations, I told them to drop me an email that return request has been taken but they never do that. They dont have a support email address anywhere on their website.

      "557,\"I purchased their wardrobe and it started falling apart right after 3 weeks. So I called and told them about their warranty of 12 months. Guess what, that's not covered under warranty. Their support lady already seemed to be in a rush that you would expect from someone who speaks to thousands enraged customers in a day. She simply told me \"\"it's not covered under warranty, can I help you with anything else.\"\" Such obnoxious behavior. Anyway, I asked what's covered under warranty? She tells'manufacturing defect'. I asked'what's that' and she keeps repeating the same word 1000 times. Finally, she tells me any problem in alignment is manufacturing defect else it's not. And then she disconnected the call. So here I am, having lost my 5k rupees and keeping their shitty product which is going to break down anytime. My advice- don't trust their shiny website. All those photos are heavily polished in photoshop. That's the reason they don't have a review option. The products don't look anything like the picture. Stay away.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "558,\"I ordered a dressing table. Which got delivered in said time. I was told the carpenter is going to come the same day to fix the dressing table. I waited for a week and since no one turned up. I called their customer care. Which is paid and no one will pick up your call. So I requested a installation in IVR call. I was told a carpenter will come the very day. I waited for couple of days and then over Chat I requested for an installation. Where the customer support guy - Arul Suresh said he will raise and request and will personally take care of this. I again trusted them and again no one turned up. So its like you order product for 10k. Then again spend money for installation. If that is the case. then also let the consumer know that you wont send anyone, so we will take care of that. So I request all the consumers not to believe in Pepperfry for installation and when they ask you to sign on the delivery form. Make this clear to them that unless someone installs it. I am not going to sign anywhere Pathetic service from Pepperfry - My dressing table is kept in my hall dismantlement. Thanks to the false promise from Pepperfry.

Now the customer service cant expedite the order, and they wont cancel the order because its against company policies. The customer service replied that I should arrange for someone to take delivery and they can change delivery in the same city. What use is the order if delivered after I am out of town. The order is not even shipped and they wont cancel or change the delivery address at an additional charge. The customer service not even trying to find a solution and simply gave up. Very poor service. Highly not recommend. Stay away.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "560,\"I ordered a wall shelf and cancel it immediately when I saw the delivery date is 1 month after the order. there was no options for cancellation. When I called to customer care, they are saying there is no policy for cancellation. Then I don't have any other options except accepting the product. When I accept the product, it was so small and some scratches are there. When I asked for refund, they are not refunding as told small scratches are normal and sorry for the inconvenience. they told they will only exchange no refund only if the product is damaged or unable to use. I have deleted my Papperfry account. Guys, Please think twice before ordering any product from Papperfry.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "561,\"Purchased a chest of drawers from them. got delivered yesterday. But as Vr not happy vid it and moreover its also damaged. Not standing on all four legs.

      "562,\"Recently I bought Morris Sofa cum bed in Royal Gray color from them order no-303096887 for rs 49500/- .they delivered me product after one month, product was in town for week but their delivery process and communication was bad and not proper to organize it well to do needful in time. I took delivery when I was not in town so could not check the product, but when I saw the color of product was totally different than what I saw online, I bought in gray color but they gave me dark coffee brown, when I complain to them about this they ask me to share pic and later they agreed with my claim and ready to take the product return and refund me back. so when asked their return team to do needful then their team couldn't handle this and sent email that the product is gray so they cant take back as its part of their policy, I called again to Customer care they again agreed that color is not gray and will take to take product return back but same response from return team again, this happened 5 times . finally they refuse my claim and on one of them including manager has convincing answer for wrong color product. I totally believe that its a fake company and we as buyer go on their name and trust buy products and pay full in advance but they don't take any responsibility ones they get payments and support customer for any of faults made by vendors, instead of taking care of customer they take care of vendors. I firmly suggest to all buyers aware of this company and not do any purchase stuff from them . it was horrible shopping experience for me and it will be for you as well. for color reference I have attached Pic. they says its Gray color.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "563,\"Order number 303098035: The Study table bought from Space wood does not have any logo what so ever. Even the box packing does not have any indication of the product has been procured from Space wood.\r\n",
      "2.  Space wood takes pride in a state of art manufacturing facility at Nagpur. Then it should take pride in putting its logo. The very fact that there is no logo, there appears that the product has been procured from some industrial area for cheap and sold to us, Pepperfry customers. I have spoken to customer care of Pepperfry as well. Though Pepperfry has delivered the product timely and in good condition. The issue is of having taken the contract from Space wood that needs to be questioned. I have bought MDF products from Zuari, Godrej as well as Style Spa. They take pride in their product which is obvious from the logo on the product.(Photos attached) I have conveyed my issue with Pepperfry. They said that they would look into it about a month ago. I am yet to hear from them. It appears that they are hand in glove with Space wood. I would hold both Space wood as well Pepperfry responsible for such sales. Now I do not have any faith in such products(so called branded) where that company feels ashamed to put its logo. Dipak 09198801616\",POSITIVE\r\n",

The product quality is low, the king bed make noise when we sit gently on it, the dining table chairs as well makes noise when someone sits. We got the furniture in the morning of January. We have made several attempts to convey the message to Pepperfry concerned department, but nothing worked. Never expected so unprofessional behavior. Very bad\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "565,\"The lamp that I got from pepperfry came with a scratch and it was in a very bad condition with the lamp shade torn and bent, for which they agreed for a partial refund after which once I used it for the first time, It blew my fuse off. They are telling they cannot do anything about it. Absolutely don't care about the customers.Bad quality and hazardous stuff sold.better go buy from good stores after seeing the products.Also no COD facility and no easy returns.Customer care agents are very unprofessional as well. Avoid!\",POSITIVE\r\n",

I love shopping Saral Home Multicolour Jute on pepperfry and I recommend others to buy if you really want to have smart shopping. at the same time I also prefer to shop other products with SaralHome. they made good products and based on the feedback received from my friends, I will shop with them again. Cheap and best!\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "568,I ordered 2 beds from Pepperfry and I struggled to get the assembly done by the carpenter. There was no contact details shared and you will have to follow up everyday and if you are lucky they might send the carpenter. One bed has a missing part. The carpenter raised with his manager and I raised to customer care. No satisfactory response I have received. No time lines they commit to resolve the problem. While delivering the order also they will deliver at any convenient time for them and not of customer. So if you are working and don't have anyone at home available all day do not order from them. Same would be for carpenter. You would wait whole day and no one comes. This is at time of sell. So post sales I don't think they will give a damn. I really regret to order from these guys. If you need peace of mind either order from any store or amazon. They are very organised. These guys will put the blame on each other and are not solution oriented. Be careful,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "569,\"I bought a Sheesham cot fot Rs 21808 from Pepperfry last 10 days back. Felt so disappointed n cheated. Wood is sooo light n after fixing too, the cot is so light weight it moves like a plastic chair. They had advertised as 93 kgs in their Ad but it is not even 20-30 kgs. Am sure it wl break if two fat people sit on it. Cot is not worth even 5000 rupees. I made a big mistake of spending my hard earned money in buying Pepperfry furniture.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "570,\"This is the second time I'm buying from pepperfry and its going to be final. I like eCommerce sites because they give you good range to choose from and good deals but the one place where some companies and unfortunately pepperfry also exploits its customers is when they come up with an unethical'all orders are final' policy. This gives the impression that they are willingly selling stuff that are useless and trying to victimize people using their sites without responsibility or ownership for their customers. Also the delivery time span is too late which is another negative aspect of pepperfry. I ordered a hardware accessory and unlike ready to use items you cannot just plug and play them. I booked a serviceman and showed him the item ordered online(same day to be sure everything was ok when it arrived) and unfortunately the accessory was something which is not suitable in my construction setup. The item was not even shipped and I requested a cancellation on the same day it was ordered after I realized the issue. I'm not a serviceman myself so ordered it by mistake. Pepperfry blatantly denied that they don't have any form of order cancellations and all sales are final. This is more like a Chinese market company where you get things without guarantee. I am surprised to see that online marketplaces have stooped down to such cheap tactics in cheating customers and making money by throwing stuff on their customers after cheating them and taking their money. I would rather go with a reputed seller like amazon or even a local hardware shop next time so that I dont have to suffer like this again. And later when I had a look at amazon I figured they not only have great returns policy but also arranges a professional to assist you with the assembly for free and takes full responsibility and ownership for the products they sell to their customers. This is exactly what we call professionalism, the trust and reputation that we expect from a brand. But sadly pepperfry does not qualify to be any of these and appears to be a cheap, struggling and greedy for money syndicate that is worse than chinese road side market shops in India. I will not recommend anyone wasting time in pepperfry and sincerely wish that such companies without any ethics  close down soon before they loot more customers for some easy money. It not how much money you make and show your investors, but how many satisfied customers you have that really count! My sincere recommendation is not to engage in any business with such unethical companies.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "571,\"Recently I bought 3 floor lamps at the same time(my mistake). In reality, none of them look as good as on the website, therefore over priced. One was alright, the second had a crooked base(still decided to keep it). Didn’t open the boxes for some days as I was out of town. Opened them the second week. I am writing about the third(jute) lamp - bland looking with crooked foot stand, no on/off switch(on/off switch noted on website), but decided to use it anyway. I left the light on for about 20 - 30 min/day just on some days. After a total of 2 hrs use, lights flickered and went off permanently. Pepperfry has refused a refund or at least replacement with a different product about the same price; this is about 2 weeks since purchase. Its a cheap looking, flimsy product with poor finish; no wonder their “warranty” is just for 1 week which I found out later and speaks for itself. They do a good job with packaging, delivery and have a neat looking website. Don’t get carried away by the looks.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "574,Order No. 300477528 6th August 2014 I urge upon all the buyers to make proper survey before making any purchase from pepperfry as off late this company is putting a trap in the name of huge discounts to the prospective buyers however these items are basically the rejected items which are returned by the lucky buyers who could locate the problems before one year of guarantee and had returned to the company. We are the unlucky lot who could not locate and when we found the defect it was over one year and when pointed out to the company they were very rude and bluntly told that after one year we can not accept your complaint. We asked them after paying so much money for the wooden furniture how come defects and huge cracks are appearing in the dining table on that they did not reply.they have a standard reply that we are referring your case to the CONCERNED TEAM which ends with a standard reply from their customer care unit that we are sorry and this is not under warranty anymore after crossing one year hence can't do anything. We called local carpenter then we came to know that it was a defective item prepared from wet wood that's why such huge cracks have emerged. He also suggested that we need to change the entire table top to bring it to a decent level. I am sharing this after seeing the various ads the company is coming out there days to help others to make a survey before purchasing. We all earn money after putting in hard work and we deserve good items when we are paying so much money for the wooden product in particular. I have shared my concerns in the pefferfry app and FACE BOOK also to make the consumers aware of these missdoings Regards SANJAY KUMAR DAS,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "575,\"I bought an idol fountain for 12, 500. It was delivered after 15 days and there was a visible crack on the product. I gave return item on the product along with the picture of the broken product. A customer service rep called me and said the original product on the site also has the same crack(this is lie since I zoomed as much as I can and could not find any damn thing on the product in their website after this call). I asked him whether they are selling product knowing that it is broken and he started to blabber that it is the finish of the product(well trained or too much of practical knowledge cheating other customers). Finally he said I can't do anything we wont take your order for return. So their policy is NO RETURN AFTER PURCHASE EVEN IF THE ITEM WE SOLD IS BROKEN. I also got an email from them. Copy pasting it below. Thank you for contacting us! With reference to your online return request of your Pepperfry Order # 302943949 – DE1556832-S-PM1573 We have a company policy where if the customer don’t like the product ordered from Pepperfry and also if it is not as expected case in such cases unfortunately we can’t take the return. Even in quality issue we do not take the return. Hence we are considering this case as closed. NEVER WILL I EVER ORDER FROM THEM AND I WILL MAKE SURE NONE OF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS DO THAT.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "576,\"This is about a single cot order which I had placed with pepperfry.Even after following the instructions for not standing on the cot or pulling it, the cot broke down within 2 months from purchase . The price of the cot was ?21, 000. The product name is Mczico single bed in white and grey finish by Mollycoddle . When I raised the issue with pepperfry immediately after it collapsed, pepperfry refused to entertain returns /refund and even repair of the cot, as it was not covered under any warranty . It was said that the issue would be raised to the vendor and pepperfry is not responsible for the quality of the product . The cot support were of material very similar to cardboard, which children use for school projects . Pepperfry calls it processed wood . It collapsed by itself without any external disturbance . They owned up of having no accountability for the product . This is message is just to warn others from buying. It is a shame on Pepperfry, the company and their customer care .\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "577,Placed an order and waiting. waiting. and waiting for delivery. Finally after 23 days with multiple follow-ups they said the order cannot be processed with no reasons. The funny part is I can again place the same order from their website. I could not understand their ethics and value for customer's time and money. Never get into this. They should at least say the problem for cancellation such us'pincode issues' or'non availability' which will help us to avoid repeating the same again.,POSITIVE\r\n",

But I am sure that I have paid money to pepperfry but they are saying they cannot do anything. call hometown!. Hence I called HomeTown, they are saying they cannot refund the money.

I said either refund the difference or cancel the order, I will place a new order with the reduced price. She said that once you have placed the order you cannot cancel it and we cannot refund the difference because you have ordered it at that price and the company does not have refund policy. Had the product been delivered and the price had reduced after that I would have not complained but the product is not yet delivered and the prices have reduced so I am entitled to get the refund of the difference.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "582,\"I purchased a Bunk Bed and matching almirah set from Pepperfry for my kids. I made the exact spacing in the room trusting Pepperfry. I placed the order on 16th December 2016 with Order No. 302723034. One of the product, the bunk bed reached me on time on around 12th January while the other product had 2 out of 4 boxes of some other product shipped by mistake at my address. Therefore I did not accept its delivery as the product was incomplete. Since then, it has been more than 1.5 months while I had not got any update from Pepperfry. The executives handling my case, Ms. Amrita and Mr. Ramesh will never come on the phone when I call. The other executives will always say that they will arrange a call back but I never got any call. My products were worth more than 2 lakh rupees. So, I will never trust pepperfry for such orders… I have everything recorded on my phone if pepperfry or its executives deny the scenario of events. The product is available on the seller website and also on other online portals but not with pepperfry. Also, the product is branded by just 1 seller in India. just in case Pepperfry wants to claim that the product isnt available with their dealer.

      "583,\"FOR PEPPERFRY MY ORDER   NUMBER IS  302900906 . NOW MY EXPERIENCE WITH PEPPERFRY 1)  Placed an order and by mistake, I have choosen the wrong address, which was by default . Now here the problem arises . I have asked them to change the address, they said no . ALL 5 ADDRESSES, I given to them, all were unserviceable .  So changing address not work 2) Then I call their customer care, which takes about 5 minutes to reach them . Almost charged 6-7 rupees for 5 minutes, then a customer representative come with almost a  machined language . He told me that there is no CANCELLATION POLICY, So delivery boy will go for delivery as long as someone will take it And chances that I will get my money back is NILL .(In Hindi, he said that HO SAKTA HAI, PASIE MIL JAYEIN) 3) I chat with a customer care and he tell me that I will get a mail about what we chat . but I reality I never recieved that  chat . A SITE TRUE FACE COMES ONLY WHEN CUSTOMER ONLY IN PROBLEM . THIS MY FIRST LITTLE PROBLEM IN PEPPERFRY  AND THEY CHARGED ME RS 1563 FOR THAT . I MADE BLUNDERS, WHILE SHOPPING ON AMAZON AND EVERY TIME, THEY COME IN FRONT AND HIDE MY MISTAKE LIKE THEY HAVE DONE MISTAKES, NOT ME . AND ALWAYS GIVING 2 OR 3 AWESOME RESOLUTIONS FOR ANY BIG MISTAKES .SO GUYS, CONCLUSION IS BUY FROM PEPPERFY ONLY, IF YOU ARE 500 PERCENT SURE ABOUT THE PRODUCT .

      "584,\"I had ordered a executive office chair and the back rest cloth came out after sitting on it literally  5 times. when I call them up they say \"\"Sorry sir we cant refund you the money after 7 days\"\" So what they mean to say is that the shelf life of the chair is only 7 days and its perfectly fine for a chair to break after that. Very disappointing. as a consumer we are taking a huge risk by ordering something like a furniture online and when something like this happens where it is obviously a \"\"manufacturing defect\"\" and we dont get the required support. it puts a question on the reliability of the entire sector. It seems like they are running one big scam here.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "585,\"I am forced to write this review even before I have received my product as that is the whole problem. PepperFry cannot get a product delivery rescheduled if you are not available to take the delivery at expected time. Their support will just take your preferred date request but will not communicate to delivery department(apparently these two teams does not work in collaboration at all). Delivery ppl will continue to attempt to deliver on their convenience and will not take one request of your convenience and availability. Its a black hole management, you just give inputs, nothing really happens to it. Re think if you are planning to order something in your absence, it might never get delivered and you might end up in frustration like me. Hopefully I will not be writing after I receive the product.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "591,\"I ordered a bed with hydraulic storage. It was delivered on time, but except on-time delivery, nothing went well with this order. I have been literally calling them almost every day from last 5-6 days. They delivered a a wrong bed, which does not even have hydraulic storage. Carpenter who came for assembly said that I need to call support for replacement. Hoping to get a replacement, I called and was told that I will get a call back in 1-2 days from their back-end team. Waited for a call for 2 days and did not receive one. So I called them again and to my surprise I was told that they already called me and I agreed for a full-refund. I had to tell them that I never received any call back whatsoever.Then they said that they can refund me 6500 if I agreed to keep the same bed. I have already sold out my old bed, and was really in need of a bed, so I agreed for this deal. However, the new bed was still packed and needed assembly. I was told that a carpenter would come in 24 hours or so. Waited for 24 hours, then 48 hours, then called back again and I was told that someone will call again. After waiting for 4 days, I called again and someone from customer service again promised that for sure next day a carpenter would arrive before 1 PM. Waited entire day again, still no one turned up. Called their support and asked for a manager, but no manager was available to speak to me as they were busy. Finally when I insisted to provide me the carpenter's phone number, I was provided his details. I called carpenter directly and he finally arrived in evening at 5.30 PM.He unpacked the bed and now we found that there is no floor-sheet included in the package(base of the bed). So now we have a bed, but we cannot store anything in it as the floor-sheet is missing. Called customer support again and was told that I will get a call back in 24 hours. STILL NO CALL BACK RECEIVED. Called them again and wanted to speak to a manager and was told that their escalations team is on lunch and they will call back before end of the day.

      "599,\"We had ordered a wooden Chest from them. Placing them was very hassle-free. the order was delivered in time ( within 10 days) But when the item was delivered, we were being told that the carpenter would be arriving the next day. But when no-one turned up or even called us, we had to call their call centre executive just to get a bit shocked that \"\"it is us who have to place the service request for carpenter for assembling this\"\", which is a very clumsy process. \"\"why dont they send the carpenter alongwith the material delivered or arrange one the next day by themselves ? \"\" It needs lot of improvement in this section. otherwise they have a good variety of items as per your requirement.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "600,\"I had bought a mango wood cot without storage from pepperfry.com in May 2016. However, by October 2016, it developed a cracking and the cot became useless. The main side bar was damaged. Pepperfry.com washed their hands off saying the warranty was only for 7 days. I even asked if they could supply the part separately, which they denied. While they advertise a lot and make you think they are good, their services are actually not comparable with their main competitor who have better customer services. I would not suggest going to pepperfry.com after my poor experience. They have a complaint registration policy which can get escalated if you are not satisfied with the first response. However, each time I tried it, they said the first complaint had to be made. I am frustrated since I paid a lot for it and assumed it would last for a long time.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "601,\"I had purchased an Executive Low Back Chair from PepperFry.com in June. It took about a month for it to be delivered. Within 3 months of usage last friday, the base of the chair just broke while I was working and I had a fall. I reported this to PepperFry customer care today and they called from Mumbai to say that the product did not have any warranty and they could not do anything for this. I guess it was my mistake too that I did not check for warranties. But please do not buy these online furniture as they are dubious quality and finally the consumer is the one who is at loss. I wish no one else suffers due to such\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "602,\"I purchased a wall clock from Pepperfry. It looked great in photos displayed on website but when I recd it and opened it, the quality was very poor. A typical chinese product. When I brought it to the notice of the company, they politely refused to listen. The reason given was that no complaints will be entertained after seven days. The clock had cost me ?3700/- whereas it should not have been more than ?500/-. The poor quality does not justify the price. I was planing to buy an expensive chandelier from them but luckily I was saved. I just wasted only ?3700/-\",POSITIVE\r\n",

They are out there to cheat public. Thanks Suma\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "605,\"I ordered two lamps and a bedsheet from Pepperfry. I was very impressed initially by the website and had high hopes for my chosen products. Both lamps and the bedsheet were delayed by 1 week on arrival, which meant I waited 3 weeks in total from the order date. Both lamps were faulty on arrival. The metal base of one was severely crushed, and both shades were severely dented. The bedsheet was not of the same color has shown on the site. I wanted to replaced the order but Pepperfry refused to replace the broken lamps, I was ok with the bedsheet n told them to just replace the lamps but they only offering to refund and collect items from my home. This was not satisfactory as I was again left without lamps! Will not be shopping with them again!.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "606,\"Bought 2 cushion covers from pepperfry. Brand name'Rang desi'. Got the product quite fast but quality of the product is not good. Looks quite cheap. Contacted customer care & mentioned the same to them, after asking me umpteen questions, imagine my surprise when they said it cannot be exchanged for such a reason! Apparently you can only exchange if the product is damaged. This is a ridiculous policy. Obviously customer satisfaction is not a factor with them, as any other website would have gladly exchanged the product & that too without asking so many questions. Terrible customer service, off handed and not very interested in resolving the issue.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "607,\"My wife ordered for a storage unit and after opening we saw that it wasn't upto the standard and didn't like the product. We wanted to return the same, however the customer care said it cannot be refunded unless it is damaged or has defect.

I checked with my carpenter, and the analysis was that the wood used in the bookshelf itself was not treated properly and has borer worms which eat through the wood. I did not expect this from Pepperfry, which proves to its customers that while their products are stylish, there is no substance.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "609,\"Hi All, I am sharing my experience of buying Furniture online at Pepperfry.com I purchased'Sofa cum Bed' on Pepperfry.com August 2016. Cons: 1) Never buy furniture online without actually looking it. 2) Pepperfry is online website only - where different vendors sell their sub-standard products. 3) You cannot see reviews for their products and make a decision, Pepperfry never allow the buyers to post review/comments or rate the product(for example: if we buy something on flipkart, then we can write review, flipkart publishes without hesitation if its negative or positive, you can check on flipkart page right now) 4) I believe most of the Positive reviews on pepperfry are to promote goodwill. when I asked why they dont allow reviews under each product, reply I got is Pepperfry is a startup and new company so they only send the comments to seller and remove the product from portfolio once they receive more complaints(which means you have to buy and experience the bad). 5) Materials(Cloth and Zip) used on Sofa is very poor, within 15 days it is worn out. You must use a bed cover/sheet on sofa since the given cover is not good. 6) Description of the product is highly advertised. It is not Clearly specified, the type of wood used is plywood(not mentioned this).the plywood doesnt last long. when you sit and getup from sofa, it makes squeaky sound. 7) Type of cushion used on sofa is not specified(Low quality sponge bed). Pictures shown are very clear but you cannot ascertain the quality by looking online. 8) It is sofa cub bed, when converted to bed it is not comfortable to sleep well as you have to fit yourself between wooden edges. Though cleverly designed, it will not serve purpose. Pros: 1) Will receive ordered product on promised delivery date and free installation by carpenter. 2) Pepperfry customer service is very good 3) Variety of different products available to choose, usually we dont find such wide range in most of the big furniture stores. ) Furniture looks good(some items are low in quality and will not serve the purpose completely) 5) Good to use as Sofa(Not value for money) Verdict:'Go ahead and Buy Furniture Online with confidence' as they advertise. You will be Confident only till you see the actual piece delivered:)\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "610,\"Guys, I had purchased shoe rack a year back(Order Number: 301522428). It is out of warranty. My shoe rack wooden door got broken. I had called customer care and I got a reply saying that \"\"Sorry Sir, its out of warranty, we cannot do anything for this. Please ask your local carpenter to repair this\"\". I told them, I am willing to pay for the door. Since the material used would only be available with them. But still they insisted \"\"Ask your local carpenter to make a new door.\"\". The wood used by many of their products are very light and the local carpenter is unable to do anything about this since he is not equipped.For all those who are considering such online wooden shopping, Please be aware of that. After warranty you are on your own. Event if you pay, they won't help you. Mind it, the materials used is not easily available in the market. For me, the whole shoe rack is now waste, which I need to throw. Luckily I did not buy fancy/costly stuff from them.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

You can't sit 30 seconds on the chair, let alone relax. When I contacted customer care, they say the product is as described, so no return option. In essence, they are telling me that a chair you can't sit on is NOT defective. I feel totally cheated. Don't t ever buy from this site.

To my surprise the customer care refused to cancel the order, though the order was no where close to being shipped. It seems like once you pay for an order they are like, \"\"Gotcha\"\", you can't escape. What kind of a return policy is this. I am surprised to see with an online retailer with such a bad cancellation policy still in business. So buyers think really hard before you place an order.and if possible go to another place where the cancellation policy is not so bad.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "616,\"I ordered a teak wood bed from Pepper Fry. The product was very good but delivery was a bit delayed. The selection of products is also quite nice. However, their selection of mattresses is not up to the mark. Finally, I bought the bed from Pepperfry but the mattress from SundayRest. Even though I placed the order for the mattress on the day when the cot was supposed to be delivered, the cot did not arrive and the mattress arrived on the same day! Overall the teak wood bed from Pepperfry is great and looks sturdy and works great with the Sunday mattresses. Pepperfry can improve on the delivery timeline.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

When I contacted the customer service, they say this is common duration. I am very surprised why it takes 2 months to get a product for which I paid the money already.

      "618,\"Ordered curtains for my house. Pepperfry cancelled one of the items(totalling around Rs. 12000) from the order from their side. I had availed a coupon during this order which gave me around Rs. 2500 off on this item. They sent an email that I can reorder and at that time they gave me a coupon of only Rs. 500. Spoke to manager and he said that since that particular sale is over he cannot give me the bigger discount. Today I noticed that the same sale is back so I called customer service and spoke to Gregory to give me the bigger discount as the order had not even been processed. He said that he is unable to give the discount, unable to cancel the order and the worst part is he refused to put in a manager call back request. Is this how they treat a customer who has spent over one lakh at their company in just the last few days? Shameful. Never been so disappointed with any other retailer. The rest of my business is going to Urbanladder. Excellent service.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "620,\"I have purchased Two lamp shades from Pepperfry.com.  At the first page they have mentioned that the Retail Price of a lamp shade is Rs.951/-. Offer Price is Rs.743/-.You save Rs.208(22%). Once you click the picture then you are going another window. Now the same this put in different way. Retail Price: Rs.951 Our Price: Rs.929 Offer Price: Rs.743 after applying FREEDOM code Shipping Free You Save Rs.208(22% OFF) Rs. 22(Retail Discount)+ Rs. 186(Limited Time Coupon) 100% Genuine, Easy Returns Offer Price Rs.743 After using coupon FREEDOM BUY NOW(Buy Now they have put in GREEN BAR) If you click by now then again you are in another window Then only their trick started. In that window the rate will appear as Rs. 959/-(951-22 retail discount). under that there is a light visible  appear apply coupon code. Here also it is not clear which code.  With out knowing their tricks I had made orders on the presumption that they will allot limited time coupon later on after the purchase is over. I have received the goods by paying Rs.929/-.  After a week I have enquired about the limited time coupon. They intelligently replied that at the checkout itself we have apply the coupon. If not, we are not eligible to get limited time coupon/FREEDOM Coupon. If they are honest and sincere their website is supposed to be designed in such a way no consumer can be affected by paying different price for a same product. Professional Ethics is supposed to be there. That means they will use different nomenclature - Limited time coupon/Freedom/retail discount to confuse consumers. If you are not capable of understanding these tricks, then the amount will be at their pocket. In the above said purchase I have lost Rs.186/- and in the same order for another lamp shade I have lostRs.162/- Amount may be meager, but their intentions, honesty, and sincerity towards consumers should be noticeable one. Please be aware of such cheating and be cautious of those using different nomenclature instead of just giving DISCOUNT in one word. Please do recognise such people and keep away from them. Amazon is thousand times better than this.A. Selvaraj\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "621,\"I am not very happy the way pepperfry handled my order. In June I ordered an over Rs5000 dinner set for my parents’ anniversary. I paid in full and I was happily waiting for my dinner-set but it never arrived. So I finally checked with them and they told me due to some reason we would not be able to deliver the product and presently we are in process of refunding your money. It’s like they didn't even bother to notify me that they will not ship the product, it really made me angry mostly because I have to make other arrangements for my parents’ anniversary at very last minute. I believe pepperfry handled the whole situation very unprofessionally. When I expressed my inconvenience they told me we are refunding your money back. To them refunding my money was more than sufficient gesture and I should be grateful for that. Well I forgot all about that until they emailed me back in August saying that the dinner-set I was looking for is back in stock again. As my heart was set on it I went on website just to find that its Rs1000 more expensive. SO I decided to try my luck again and called the customer service to match my price considering it was not my fault last time product was not delivered. Their reply was straight out we cannot do anything about it. It’s like they are not even making effort to make their customers happy. I might end up ordering this dinner set as its absolutely beautiful in Bone China from Clay Craft and it is hard to come by on other websites though I’ll try again. God knows I am not planning to do business with pepper fry anymore ever again.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "622,\"I have order shoe rack from this site on 3rd Aug 2016 and item reached to pune warehouse on 5th Aug as I got to know via sms.

I said ASAP but they said It will be delivered by 8th and You will get SMS between 9-10AM. on 8th, I called them at 10 AM and got reply that wait for 12 PM and you will get the delivery details by SMS but no details recieved. Then I called 12PM they said due to some reason they will deliver tomorrow. I was surprised by such answer by pepperfry.com because they have scheduled it for today ad if they are failed to do that they must tell the customer but here customer is following up for your failures. BTW they are very gud in their service, I dont know what happens this time. I am unhappy because I didnt get any update from them on time. Waiting for their update by tomorrow now and hope I will get some details as per their commitment.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "623,I bought a teak bunk bed from them almost a year ago. It was delivered a month after placing the order. I hope that has improved. But my problem is with the product. It initially smelled of the warnish and was not usable. I thought that would go away with time and waited for a few months to start using it. It took more than 5 months for that smell to go away completely. By that time my kid got used to sleeping with us.:). The drawers at the bottom of the bunk bed does not have a frame. It just rolls on the ground. AND it is much smaller than the bed so if you push it in it will go much further than the face of the bed. So much for discounted product. The ladder too does not fit properly into the slot that is provided and hence a safety risk. We had to teather it to the bed using a chain. Now we see that the board supporting the bed(which is NOT teak) is infested with mold and because of this smell we cannot even use the room. I realize now that the discounted product means that they replace hard wood on many part of the furniture with this cheap cardboard like material which is prone to mold. One of my worst online purchases so far. Would not recommend them and their discounted products.,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "624,\"I ordered a kids trundle bed online from pepperfry on 13 th july. Little did I know the annoyance that awaited me. The bed was supposedly shipped from Mumbai warehouse on 15th july and reached Gurgaon on 20 th july. However after that updates stopped coming. I tracked the order through online chat and was told it would arrive tomorrow everytime! The reason they gave was routing problem, which was hard to believe, as Gurgaon is about 40-50 kms from my house and they are taking 6 days already to cover it! My order number is 302348896. It being a gift item, naturally I wanted it on time. However, still I am waiting patiently for it to arrive TOMORROW. They don't bother to call or inform about anything. Neither they provide the contact details of any delivery personnel. My only gain is I am wiser now to check online reviews before making full payments online and stick with trusted names.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "625,\"I ordered sesame wood furniture, a center table and dining set. I paid high considering it is brand will have quality but no it is not the case. Both the products delivered were not in acceptable quality. Center table alignment was missing and one chair of dining table was broken. However I got 40% for damaged chair but I never wanted to buy damaged product. But soon in a week time both product started tearing from every corner. We requested for return which took time and money refund is still in process. But surprise is that I have not received single call from pepperfry saying how they can help to give quality or for thier apologies. Attached is one image but this damage we have seen in each corner of the furniture. Quality of pepperfry is very bad and their service is too pathetic and more important is that their customer support team is very good in talk but ultimately they don't care about customer.

      "628,\"I ordered groceries for my home from Big basket recently, the prices were all good everything was on a discount and I ordered all the branded packeted items just couple of vegetables so I was not worried about the quality either. During the transaction they ask the slot of delivery so according to my schedule I kept it 8-10 am in the morning. What I didn't knew was they are extra efficient and reached my doorstep at 7am only without even calling on my phone but somehow I opened the door from half sleep and what I see is the guy came to deliver only 1 vegetable and when I asked about the rest the groceries will be delivered shortly, I was angry as hell they disturbed me from sleep just to deliver 1 lady finger packet. Never going to order or even I do I will never put delivery slot in the morning\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "629,\"I ordered from Bigbasket twice in the last month and here's my experience with them. Two salad sauces were 6 months old, going to expire in 3 months and not even dust was wiped off the bottles. Why should I pay total cost if I get to use them only for 3 months? I returned them and demanded for complete refund to my bank and not my BB wallet. I went without a meal and had to wait for my husband to go to Spar and finally finish shopping. They instead credited it to my BB wallet. I thought I will give it a try again. Papaya fruit was green, Fresho Organic Veggie Basket, Combo( 5 Items) - Ladies fingers smelled strong fruity stale smell, they were probably stored with some other fruits unpacked. Among the potatoes one was totally damaged. Beet root were old, they were too soft to clearly say it all. Onions were again old, too strong to be able to eat in salads. I wanted to order Broccoli but all I could order was Broccoli florets which costs me Rs129 for 200g, where I could get 2 broccoli for Rs125. Again going to be hungry till I can go out again. I forgot about carrots so wanted to add them in the night to morning delivery, if add to the same delivery slot we are not charged extra for shipping. But I wasn't able to order carrots as it said out of stock. Checked back early at 3 am but the delivery slot was already booked. So If order carrots separately I will have to pay Rs58 for carrots and Rs50 for delivery, completely worthless. They are there just to loot customer's money. They stopped bothering about good customer service, customer experience and fresh delivery on time. I am now scared about ordering again with these guys, really not sure what are they going to deliver. One good thing about this website is that they take a return with no questions asked. But return the fruits or vegetables immediately. If someone else accepts the delivery for you, you can imagine what could happen to your money. It is really not worth your time and money.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "632,\"I downloaded bigbasket mobile app and placed very first order of mine on 19th nov 2017. Order number was MSUFO-36514311-191117. I got a call from 020 7102 2017 and the bigbasket executive told me that he will confirm me whether their service is available at my pincode 396445 ( Navsari, Gujarat) or not. I requested him to confirm the same within half an hour so that I can purchase the same items from nearby store like reliance fresh. I did not get any call and finally I got a call from big basket in the evening at 6: 40pm and the executive informed me that their service is not available at pincode 396445 and they are cancelling my order. I asked him a simple question that if your service is not available in my pincode then why your app shows me the area and same pincode in drop down list while selecting the pincode. Why you do not remove the same and prompt customer at the time of placing order that your service is not available at this pincode. Why you accept order and payment. Bigbasket executive told me thay their service was previously available at this pincode but now they have wind up services. And he told me that the process of removing the area puncode from their software or app is in process. I dont think it would take longer time to ammend the same. He told me like it was such a big task like developing microsoft windows operating system. It was funny. Finally my order was cancelled. The most shocking thing is that they mentioned the reason of cancellation that the address was incomplete. How big liers they are. They did not accept that their service is not available. This is really very strange that your app has bug and you accept order and payment and then you say your service is not available and you are working on updating your server data. I can not believe. Bigbasket makes so much promos on TV and media but there are lots of such issues I think. They are winding up their services I think as the bigbasket executive told me that they were previuosly serving to my pincode but now they are not serving. There may be such many pincodes which may be showing in app but the service may not be available. Bigbasket tries to show that they have vast network but actually it is not. Navsari is not so interior area. It is nearby Surat but bigbasket service is not available. I just dont trust bigbasket as they are liers and they can go to any extent to hide their inabilities. Dont trust.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

Really this is such a nice way to get all the grocery items. Customer service is very good. They give information before they deliver products. And they deliver quality products. I have app in my phone, because of that we receive messages at the time of discounts. Regularly I am using this app. Two days before itself I receive delivery Order# EHVO-35901478-071117.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "635,\"I made an recent order at big basket which lead to actual headache and high level frustration for me first their help center number are not toll free and second their call take almost an hour each time. I have 100 Rs extra for call made to bigbasket people at big basket are just not bothered about the customers, they just show it off.My ordeal : I placed an order for Friday evening, which due to some circumstances I had to shift to Saturday morning note the credibility of these people, they somehow took freedom to reprocess my order, half of my order just vanished and other half was rescheduled to another time with out my prior knowledge again it was rescheduled as per convenience of the delivery guys and bigbasket when I try to enquire about the order, nobody in the entire company has a clue about the where about of the order or the person concerned. The so called delivery manager is so damn busy that the person is unreachable. The customer care center team leader has position equal to the prime minister of India so busy and unavailable and coming to attend a call isn't in this profle so low profile task for him. Almost floor supervisor will be available for the help finally after talking to 7-8 different person in customer care center and no RESOLUTION. I had to finally cancel my order to I told them to refund amount to my bank but as usual they didn't listen carefully and refuseded my big basket wallet get again I thank for the great support team Bigbasket!\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "636,Hi Guys today I want to share my own experience on BigBasket.com. Im using this website from 1 month and im very satisfied from it as it gives us all a very fast and secure delivery with 100 percent original product. As I have ordered 1 peanut butter on 10: 00 pm at night and I got my product on 8 am as promised on 9am-11am and I have got it before 1 hour which is really appreciated. I have got a really good experience from big basket and I will recommend you all to buy the products from this website without any issue. Thanks.,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "637,\"I start using Big Basket only year back and use it 5-10 times to check their service and quality but my experience was not good. They provide average Customer Service to their Client and users and trying to resolve all the issue with their product and service. In my first ordered and a couple of other ordered also, some of the ordered products are not fresh, even crossed expiry date. Delivery TAT, which they committed and actual delivery time has a large difference, sometimes they take 4-5 hour. Big Basket can make more user-friendly to their \"\"App & Website\"\" so that people easily can operate it. As a user, I can easily choose my product but the product which I get from them, it should be fresh, as an end user I can not rely on it.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "638,I started using bigbasket few days ago. I purchase essential house hold items from Bigbasket. Since going out to the market and purchasing is not a easy task. Its very much time consuming. And over that of the list of items arr big then carrying the big big bags are the big issue. So I thought of trying this app. I wanted to check the price of the items. They were very reasonable and not much. So I ordered few items and surprisingly they delivered the item within few hours. The items that I have ordered were even fresh. So most of the time I use bigbasket for my shopping. I recommend you to buy from bigbasket. Its trustworthy. : ),POSITIVE\r\n",
      "639,Big basket is one of the india's fastest growing online grocerry site with fastest delivery service and improved productive services wih genuine cost.We found very door step delivery service and very genuine quality that cant be avoided and cannot found easily in other e-commerce websites/apps. Simply it can be described as it is very affordable to a common man and also to rich person. Not only about quality service also about the cost service.,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "640,\"Big basket is organising bogus sales promotion contests .I have been buying from them from past two years, participated in one such bogus contest organised by Kohinoor Rice with the help of big basket. Received a call from Kohinoor Rice saying that I have won a microwave as winner of third prize in first week of August. Ever since I have been calling up Kohinoor Rice following up for my prize but it was all bogus. They keep on saying next week next week. Worse Yes WORSE is that big basket from whom I have been buying ever since they came into the entity form when approached did not even bother to react to my complaint and address it . I had asked the customer care to put me on to big basket promotion manager to make him aware how it's customer s are being duped, no one cared to call. I m a busy and pretty well off person, if I had some time I would have dragged both these companies to the consumer court. If any advocate is interested I can provide evidence and details.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "641,\"Yesterday morning I had placed order for spinach. the default time was 7-10.b4 tis too I had ordered once.I didn't receive doorstep delivery. instead I had to step out of house, n search for the delivery man.n yesterday night he has reached 9kms away from my house and asking me where my house is.n it was around 9:15pm.I requested him to deliver it the next morning. big basket representative called me, and blamed me for placing the order 7-10. instead of delivering the product the next morning, he cancelled my order.I want to know, does big basket expects me to step out of house so late, n search for the delivery man around 9:45pm? It's really rude towards your customers\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "642,\"Guys I ordered fruits and vegetables 2 times from this site and then I never ordered again. Let me tell you all my experience. First off all the one of the biggest problem is delivered late. 2 days late but it was fine untill I got to know that there was no mention about weight and packaging date on dry fruits. How could we believe on them. They can cheat us they can deliver low quality or rotten fruits. And also dry fruits were not looking fresh and healthy. They were like all of their oil( protein) was already ejected from them. And I got no bill. Their customer service is also very bad theuy do not pick up your call. And second time I ordered vegetables as my neighbors suggested me to order. But again unsatisfaction. Vegetable were stale rotten, not fresh and then I never ordered again. They should turn off their shop or we should complain to consumer court for these kind of online shopping sites. Because these kind of sites aren't following government rules. The cost vegetables and dry fruits was also very high as compared to offline kirana store. I want to ask them a question that what will happen if they provide us good quality material. Because in this way they are losing their reputation\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "643,\"I recently choose to puchase my grocery online. to save my time & money also??.I made id on bigbasket. and added approx 10 items in my basket & choose my office address for delivery. I choose express delivery option ( they claim 150 mins delivery) by paying Rs. 30 extra. firstly they themself broke my order in two parts ( 8items in one oreder, 1 item of rs 24 in one order and cancel 1 item self without asking or intimating me) and add Rs. 30 as delivery charge for each order . & you have to bear charges if you cancel ( min rs. 30) . they give me delivery time before 4: 52. my office opens till 5: 30. after 5: 15 no one came. then I call their cutomer care( alothough they are quite responsive. I like them for this) they apologise for the inconvenience . and added Rs. 50 as guaranteed delivery penalty. and I told them to deliver it next day with other ( 1 item) in the time slot of 9am to 12pm . they said ok sir. bt when I reached home . I had a message that your package will be deilvered before 9 pm. this is ridiculous. how I supposed to be in my office when I m my office closes after 5: 30pm . and I already told them . after a long conversation( fruatrating) they cancel my order by deducting my money i.e. Rs. 60 for two orders and now my wallet balance is -10 after adjusting Rs. 50 that they added to my wallet previously\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "644,\"I had ordered dry fruits, delivery was in time. But when I got the items there were no information mentioned on the package. They were just packed in a transparent cover without mentioning actual weight, date of packaging, no other information mentioned as per government rule. Just plain cover. I can see small insects running inside the packs. They didn't even provide any bill for the purchase. They are not following any consumer norms prescribed by the government. If it's done so how can the customer know the actual weight of the product, how can one know how old the products are and the quality of it. Without bill how can anyone sell things like this. The product sale was totally against the government norms and customer safety and customer rights.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

Site is showing discounted amount but is not acctually just playing with minds of people by marketing startegy. selecting product from site is also tough as you need to remember all things name in ENglish What if we donot remember the Hindi Transaltion of products. I will rather prefer go to marts on weekend for shopping.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "655,\"I have been buying from big basket from the day it started I agree that their service were not very good then but now they have improved a lot their customer service is good and they act promptly, and even if they are late you get a cashback, the best pary is their payment terms you can pay from a different cards, wallets. Now they have even started with a lot of extra items like meat, birthday cakes and bakery items. Sometimes there are times when they get items which are torn or broken but they do it back and dont charge for it or gives a cash back. this review which I am writing is only for mumbai am not sure about other cities.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

And when I was expecting for the delivery, they did not. I tried chasing them by contacting with vendor. They said that they still have cake with them and bigbasket executive did not pick it.

      "662,\"I buy vegetables from bigbasket very often and am very much happy with their customer service. The concept behind this is that it picks up vegetables in bulk from mandis and supplies it to its customers according to no. of orders and because of that we get fresh veggies. The quality of vegetables is up to the mark and the delivery time they require is really awesome , we get 1 day delivery for many products. It also has got app where we can buy and also not to forget we get exciting discounts on it. Overall this is wonderful concept for service people who doesnt get time for shopping and also for lazy lithagic people who doesnt want to go out .\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "666,\"I had ordered a yellow and blue gown on 22nd of august for Eid from craftsvilla. I had received my product on 11th july and it was very different from what I had ordered .

      "667,\"I had a terrible experience with Craftsvilla. I bought a jewellery from their website and opted for cash on delivery. On the day of delivery in the morning I get a message from their courier partner Aramex and I have posted their message here that I have an option to pay online via Paytm. since I was not at home and my mother who is 70 years of age was alone at home, I decided to use the link and pay via Paytm the amount. After some time I got a message saying that the parcel has been delivered and payment via cash has been taken. I immediately call my mother who tells me that the courier person came, delivered the parcel and demanded the money. Since my mother was alone at home, she did not have any option but to pay as she was scared. Now I have made a double payment to Craftsvilla. I call them up and they ask me for proof of payment which I immediately email to them. Now it has been 3 days and they keep writing to me both on FB as well as my email that they have only the cash payment, where I have shown them proof that Aramex has taken payment from me both by cash as well as Paytm. I am yet to get any resolution, their FB team asks me to call Customer care and customer care asks me to write emails. Also to note, their FB team deletes all negative comments and posts them as spam, so that the same is not visible to others. This essentially means they dont want any negative comment on their page. And yes, their product is damaged too!\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "670,Hi friends today I am going to share my experience based on purchasing with craftsvilla.com. First of all let me tell you that craftsvilla website is very poorly designed and most of the sellers on this website or local sellers of Delhi and Mumbai. User interface of this website is very poor. Website is very slow and it takes enough time to load images. Second thing about them is they fool people by showing different images then original product. Original product looks different then the images they show on their website. Quality of products are very bad and you will waste your money if you buy from this website. Third thing is about their Customer services which are pathetic. I ordered a product from craftsvilla and the quality of product was very bad so I decided to return the product. I mailed them regarding the issue and they told me to send the packet via courier to the address they sent me on mail. I asked them to refund my money after I packed the product and sent them via courier. They refunded my amount approximate 15 days after I packed and sent the the product to them. Last one is about the app it hangs a lot and when you click on the products they load very slowly and you will face many problems and surfing via app. Their app is also pathetic. So readers you are not getting anything good with craftsvilla and I request you not to buy anything from craftsvilla as all the services are pathetic and you will face many problems at the time of buying product till you will return it. Please don't buy.,NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "677,\"My experience with craftsvilla has not been very good and here I am going to share my last shopping experiences with craftsvilla. I have made two purchases on craftsvilla.com and had the same experience with the product quality. The first time when I ordered a kurta for my sister, it was found to be of poor quality and design. Many of the fabric strings were coming out and the piece was not stitched properly. We contacted the company for what they said that all the products are factory manufactured and so, sometimes fabrics are loose and they can be repaired. we had to pay the tailor for repairs! The second time, we bought some combos during a sale for my whole family. When all the products came, some of them were used as there was some soil and dirt sticking on the clothes. It was really really annoying and we had to return the goods back to them. I highly dislike craftsvilla and would never recommend it to anyone!\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "688,\"Craftsvilla which is an online website for buying ethnic stuff is not worth it. The products which they display online is not as same as they deliver, as simple as that! My mom ordered a stiched salwar-suit which was for around Rs.3000, we got that delivered in 3 weeks plus the quality of the fabric was so bad, it had a thin stuff and a bad embroidery which was not same as shown on the website. The suit which we saw on the website was pretty much beautiful in looks and so we ordered that but after opening the parcel, we were in regret for wasting our 3K. So, I will just say, if we give you our hard earned money, we want a good quality product, that's it! I know that they sell their products at somewhat lower prices than the others, but due to low prices, quality of the product is compromised. They should keep genuine pricing and the genuine products.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

The cost of the item is high as contrast with other shopping site. The quality delivered is worst and not acceptable. Delay in delivery Delay in refund process. I surprised to see the quality, I feel guilty in front of my friend. They make people fool. Never use this site again and not recommend to use this.

I chose this website because it had really cheap prices. It took almost 25 days for the product to arrive. Finally, it arrived and I did not open the product in front of the courier boy. I opened it almost 2 hours later as I was busy. I found that one of them was broken. The other 4 spinners were in good shape. But the quality was very bad. They don't even know how to pack the products. The toy felt like I bought it from a local bandi for not more than 10 Rs. I was seriously disappointed and lodged a complain about the broken product. They told me that they would refund me the amount. Yesterday the courier boy came and took the broken product back. Guys, I ADVISE YOU TO DON'T GET FOOLED BY THESE CHINESE WEBSITES. THEY INDEED SERVE THE WORST QUALITY OF PRODUCTS. INFACT THE PRICES ARE CHEAPER, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCT QUALITY TOO!

For free delivery you have to place your order minimum of rupees 500/- that is fine. My order was about Rs.1400/-. They promise to deliver on 28 of November and they kept their promise. Now the problem part is the quality of products. The pulses was smelling & the sticker was torn from bathroom cleaner now how can I know the quality, MRP(maximum retail price)and expiry date of the product. So, I decided to cancel my order but I didn't found any option for return or cancel. The whole website was unorganized. After lots of efforts finally I found the cancel option & I cancelled my order.

They promised to deliver the product on 30th of November, between 4 to 7 PM and kept their promise. Now, come to the problem part. I live on the first floor, and mentioned that clearly in the delivery address. As the delivery boy came, I requested him to come to the first floor, but he refused to come to the first floor. Finally, I went to ground floor, and lifted 10 KG of wheat floor and 4 other items myself till 1st floor.

Product quality is usual and ordinary. Delivery is worst thing and their delivery services are only meant to cheat customers and they never deliver order on time as it happened to me always .

      "720,\"Here, I'm gonna share with you about my experience with grofers. Couple of months before when I usually used to shop on grofers I felt that its the best grocery app from which I am familiar with. They provides delivery services to your home . There are two options available for delivery one is express delivery and other is standard delivery. When I used grofers at that time they used to provide lots of more offers,a free delivery was available for shopping of Rs 500/- with cash back. The new user can have more grofers's offers as they provide 20% cashback for new user. But as of now I dont use grofers as they do not provide the offers which they have provided before. The offers of cash back is now available for minimum shopping of RS 2000/-. That take me a little far from grofers. So one can shop on grofers if they want all the grocery items in their home without need to go anywhere.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

I generally downloaded because my friends suggests that their services are so good and they provide services all over India. When I heard this from my friends I just gone to my house and searched about it and found good reviews of the site. So I just bought few of the items from the selected store and even I got a coupon code for it got a discount of 20% . And I was very happy. When I booked my services they told that they would deliver the product by tomorrow, so that I felt bit sad about the time taken by them, otherwise it was a superb experience with grofers.com\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "723,\"I buy vegetables from grofers very often and am very much pleased with their service.The concept is that it picks up vegetables in bulk from mandis and supplies it to its customers and because of this we get fresh veggies. The quality of vegetables is up to the mark and the delivery time they require is really awesome , we get 1 hr delivery for certain products. It has got app where we can buy and also not to forget we get exciting discounts on it and for 1 time user we get 250 rupess cashback on purchase of 250 amd above. Overall this is wonderful concept for service people who doesnt get time for shopping and also for lazy lithagic people who doesnt want to go out.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "724,\"I was in Bangalore for my 30 days training last month where I used Grofers to get my Daily need items to get delivered like eggs, Bread, Butter, Soaps, Shampoo etc. But everytime when I placed order the Delivery was late. Second, the quality of some products(Bread/Eggs) was not as per the price I paid. Third, the delivery boys where not at all professional, they were only speaking Kannada which I don't know. They were neither understanding English not hind at all, so it was very difficult to communicate with them about my delayed delivery. After placing 2-3 orders, I had stopped using Grofers, I am using Big Basket which offers great discounts when we make payments through Paytm/Mobikwik. I would strongley recommend BIG BASKET for Grocery and Fruits/Vegetables purchase.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "725,My name is Anurag Singh Patel and mobile no. is 9619451917. I ordered from grofers date 13 Nov. But the product is not delivered still. If these guys don't have sufficient product or stock than why manipulate customers for delivery time. Vegetables and fruits are daily need thing how we can wait till 24 hrs. It must be clear in terms of delivery date and time. Finally they cancelled my order. What is this?,NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "726,\"I had ordered grocery from Grofers with specifically opting for NOT to send any alternate products in case of product nonavailability. Despite they sent product of y brand when ordered for x brand. Nevertheless, one of the packet was delivered as open. Delivery boy denied to take it back. Raised ticket however its been 2 days and there is no response from the company! Looking to go legal against the company.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "727,\"Hi Friends, I am from Kolkata & I am using grofers for quite some time now for purchasing online groceries & stuff. Here are my 5 Points to read before you order products on grofers. Products- You will find almost all the products from here. Product range is quite wide. There are Groceries, Fresh products, Vegetables, Fruits, Meat, Fishes, Beauty & wellness products, Bakery & Sweets, Baby products, Electronics items and even large home appliances. But it is best to order only groceries from here. Products quality is good, You can trust. Pricing: Products pricing is lower than Market in groceries section but I find Other items sold on grofers is a bit costlier comparatively other online sites. You will find always some coupons to get 10% to 20% discount on the products. So I would say Pricing is better for groceries comparatively. Grofers APP: Placing an order is quite easy with the application of grofers.(I am using ANDROID). Finding any items of your choice is quite easy as there is search option available in the app or either you can search within sections, Products are well categorized under different sections.There is option to pay Cash on delivery or Using credit Card/ Debit card, Net banking & different Wallets. Delivery Time: I was getting same day delivery here in Kolkata before but Since last 2-3 months I am getting Next day delivery. Not a big deal breaker though if you are not in a hurry. Customer Service: Customer Service is quite helping. easy to call & talk with for any issue.RECOMMENDED\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "728,\"Hello, This is regarding Order#GR249976052 I have place the order on 01 Sep 2016 and I got the delivery on 02 Sep 2016. I have order 4 pack of diaper which contain 34 pcs diaper each. When deliver completed and I check the product I got 6 pack of diaper which contain 17 pcs each. means 34 diapers are missing and also wrong qty of pack is deilverd. When I call to customer care they hold me for 2 minutes when we reach to seller but its tooks 12 minutes and your customer care executive said that seller is not contactable. So this is second day of since I place the order. Third day when I try to contact grofers same thing happens like they put my phone on hold for 12 minutes and when I force to conference with seller your executive are ready and I talk with seller on conference call and he promised me to replace the items and give missing items before day end. This is now forth day since I place the order and still same is not resolved and seller not came for replacement or deliver missing product. When I call to seller he said that I will deliver before 4 PM. and now this is 5:00 and seller is not deliver or replace damaged product. when I call to your customer care they said seller will deliver product tommrow as he is busy. I said I dont want your product please initiate refund and your executive said return is happends only tommrow as seller denied to come today. I said I suffering from 4 days and I think I am victim of your application I paid money but I did not received the order this is pathatic. I deciced to call seller as seller is call me yesterday for deliver the order when I call to seller he said we are not free for you undersatnd we have so much order. I said why you listed your name in gorfers if you are not satisfied with customer needs. They said it none of your business and shut the phone on my face. This is height of irresponsibility . When I call to grofers now they said if return is not done from the seller we are not responsible now I feel like cheated customer and big victim of your company. If you are not responsible for anything why don't you shutdown your company now? I raise the cancel request order and same thing is happends now seller is denied to come today he said I will reverce pickup tomorrow and when I ask if reverse pickup is not done who is responsible then your executive said we are not responsible if reverse pickup is not done and we will not release money if seller not pickup the product. Please suggest on this and please inform you are going to shutdown because I am surprise with service I never had any issue with bigbasket and other companies but you are doing business like this then please share with us so we will beware in the future to orders with company like you. Thanks Shankar Gidwani 99781xxxxx\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "729,I ordered grocery items from grofers. I receive a message that I will receive the product in 3 to 4 working days. But I didn't receive the product within the time period they told.

      "730,\"Hi bought some groceries and staples from Grofers thinking it might have a good service. But to my surprise I got the items delivered approximatly 6 hours late after following up for 4-5 times with the customer care. When ever I call to the customer care they said we had escalated and you will get a call from our customer service but I never get a call back or anything from them. Because of these people delay delivery and non responsive I bought some goods again from outside which makes me double the items. After delivering the delivery boy is saying sorry for the delay and he left. Really shame on these guys, there is no customer service or customer satisfaction required for these people. Guys please be informed to customer regarding the order.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "731,\"I ordered a few items on grofers. However the delivery was made 2 hours late than the actual delivery time . and after that I find that three items in the order were missing which the delivery person did not even inform me about the missing items. Only after I called him, then he agreed that the items were not available and that the cashback will be processed . And then the cashback has been added to the grofers wallet rather than adding it to the orginal bank account. now I have no option but to order on grofers again in order to use the wallet balance\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

Grofers is both availaible on app and on website.The app loads fast.The app takes up your location when you t to order that includes vegetables, fruits, dairy product and everything you need for our grocery.After you pay for them or chose any other option for payment you get your delivery with the time they mention( maximum 3 hrs in my case) . They also give offers like 20% discount and also you can pay from your paytm wallet or mobiwik wallet.And tje delivery is free if the total order amount is above 349.

      "736,I have used this online grocery shopping service for more than 6 months and haven't found no issues so far. Their delivery timelines are very accurate most of the times. Whenever they find items we ordered not in stores they call us and recommend about the alternate products on time. In case if we are not interested in the alternate brand or products they simply refund the money. Their free shipping limit is also very awesome and it is just Rs 250 and they just made other similar service vendors to reduce their free shipping limit. I love their packaging and it is environment friendly. Hope this would continue in future.,POSITIVE\r\n",

      "738,\"I ordered 6 ltr of oil which cost 90rs and 2ltr of oil which cost 108. I had received the products within 2 hrs. Also I got 20percent offer for whole order and 20 percent cashback for paying via mobikwik! Now my delivery guy came and said that he needs to refund me 36rs, I thought they would have reduced price so he s offering me the diff in price. But later on seeing the products I found that I didnt receive 2ltrs of oil which cost 108 thats the reason they refunded 36rs instead I got 90rs oil. Now I dont know whether I need to appreciate their goodwill gesture of returning differntial amount or discourage them for not informing me earlier. I didnt have any problem with changing product without informing me but what happens if the customer is little serious abt this kind of things! The product bag I received is env. friendly, also recently they announced that if 3 bags are returned they would giveback 50rs thats a better way to recycle/reuse the bags!\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "739,\"I ordered a bundle pack of goods through grocers. The delivery boy kept on pestering me on phone asking me about my home directions. After a pretty long time I wrung him and asked about his whereabouts. He answered that his company has ordered him to deliver the products tomorrow . I was suppose to make my dinner with the  procurements. But, now have to keep a fast; good? For Navratras. As far as the site is considered it is quite user friendly. The concept is also good but the management is weak. They lack professionalism. How much does it takes to hand over a detailed area map to these delivery boys.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "740,\"I have placed an order 02 Dec, 2017(Saturday) which was scheduled to be delivered on 3 Dec, 2017 Sunday in b/w 5 am to 8 am.

The company representative told me your order has been deliver in the wrong address, we will sent your order next day tomorrow on 05.12.2017 b/w 5 to 8 pm slot. but as on till date 06.12.2017 not received order from grofers, Today I had send again compliant on this mail id info@grofers.com, shubham.arora@grofers.com, after received representative call & mail from grofers, \"\"We extremely apologise for the inconvenience caused\"\" we will do The refund of Rs.4079/- against the order GR802380447 has been initiated, it should reflect in your original mode of payment in 5-7 working days. then it was cancelled my order, I have already lost my 4 days for the order delivery and already paid payment on 2 dec 2017, further why should be wait for the refund amount in 5 to 7 working days. if I have paid amount immediately, why so wait refund same amount in working 5 to 7 days. I suggest all dont buy from grofers, they are doing cheating with online customer & enjoy the credited amount 10 to 15 days.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF TIME WAS 10 AM TO 1 PM HOW WITHOUT UPDATE THEY CAN DELIVER BEFORE TIME WITHOUT ANY CALL. I have chosen time according to my availability and this which I am going through. total irresponsible attitude even I tried customer care which is not toll free and after giving several call have not got chance to any executive only my balance was drained. what kind of service industry it is, it is for sure from next time onward I m not going to place order and suggest u be careful. if u think I am lying my order id-GR976034614\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "742,\"I have ordered 14 items but they have delivered 2 only, this is really disgusting service. Delivery boy said I got the refund but who cares about the refund, we need vegetables in the morning not your refund. Again I have to go to buy market then what is the point of having online business. They should not accept the order if not able to deliver the products or they should give well prior intimation so that consumer can order from different website. Show as chipest but absolutely bad service and make your effort double to get your things. Please dont order from Grofers. Like I am wasting my writing all these in websites and lastly I have to go to the market to get vegetables for cooking.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

This is pathetic service. You except customers to wait for 4 days to get your groceries. I am not in a flood hit area or living on an island where I should be kept waiting for 4 days! I have brought products previously on Grofers but this however will put an end to my association with Grofers and the competitors are surely going to gain. I am sure if it is an \"\"operational issue\"\" as they say, its going to be big time loss.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "751,\"This was the first time I ordered from Grofers. I ordered fruits and vegetables. When delivery boy came, He just got few items with full bill. Infact the quality of some vegetables were pathetic. Its not trustworthy at all. I will never order through it. And will surely recommend my friends and relatives not to order through this site. They charge more price and give bad quality. Infact they also charge for the item they have delivered.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "752,\"I booked about 8K worth of orders(Grocery & regular home needs) from Grofers.com, a day later the things were delivered. I usually check the totaling, Items, Quality etc after delivering, however, this time I was away for two days and the delivery remained unopened for two days. Now, I realized the few products were missing(free ones) which is why I orders for those product in first place. I haven't even checked my entire list! Grofers have a policy that if the customer doesn't claim for undelivered product then it is theirs not the customers. How weird and convenient it is for them to do this. Basically \"\"You pay and they cheat and keep the product like scoundrels\"\". Its not that I have time for these things(which is which we shop online) nor the worth of the product, but the Unethical ways of doing Business of this FIRM/COMPANY makes me Furious. The Atrocity of them saying that after 48 hours \"\"We won't reconcile your delivery and not give you products which you paid for\"\" makes my blood boils.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "753,\"Hello, I ordered some vegetables and fruits from grofers and did a payment from my hdfc netbanking because they were giving cashback of 15%. Earlier also I ordered goods from here but all were cash on delivery. This time I got cheated because my payment debited twice and there is no one replying on e mails and not even on customer care number. I tried calling them 95 times but everytime they put me on hold and cut my phone. Tomorrow I am going to consumer court with all proofs.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "754,\"I bought some grocery items using Grofers app. The packing of 1 item was defective. I reported the same to the Vendor who promised to replace but didn't even after reminders. When reported to Grofers Custmer Care, I was asked to mail snapshot of the product which I promptly did. The next day I sent a reminder mail but no response received from Grofers. I also called customer care but the guy was not even interested in listening to what I wanted to say. He just said OKAY I will call back. When I tried to provide him the order details he hung up.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "755,\"Regarding OrderID GR976679630, my order was rescheduled more than 2 times, and even after re-scheduling, they say that the Order is Out for Delivery, it has been more than 4-5 hours and the order is not yet delivered. I called the Customer care, what they say is \"\"we are sorry\"\" and the order will be delivered in next 30 mins, it has been more than 1 hour but there is no response from them. There can be no estimation of how much \"\"harassment\"\" this has caused to me. Moreover Grofers takes payment in advance, so there is a confusion if we cancel the order they will refund after 8-10 days, so should we wait for the Delivery person or not is the concern. My MOM is alone at home with a fractured hand waiting for the vegetables to be delivered, The customer care guys are in Delhi and they don't have any knowledge about the Delivery in Bangalore. How will they function? such companies which are on Funding should not be allowed to operate and should be immediately taken down.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "761,\"Hi friends, here is your friend moturam and today I will share my experience with caratlane.com website. I had recently ordered 5 items from Caratlane.com. It was one of my worst experience I ever had buying things online.a very special online company which doesnt update order statuses. Even after delivering the item, it shows “Solitaire order placed”Never honour their delivery commitment. It would always be late by a week atleast.Their delivery team would drop the order with security guard without asking/ notifying you. And you could never track your order online as I explained in first point.Change in the product actual weight from what you ordered is a norm for the rather than exception.My suggestion: buy from store or Bluestone. Bluestone team experience was awesome. Thanks for reading my review. Please rate my review useful or very useful. Have a nice day.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

I contacted someone but that person didn't follow up and kept me waiting for a week inspite of writing some emails to the team Cratelane. I was about to give up then I made another attempt to call and Shikha came for my rescue. She is a very sincere person and a boon to the company. We need people like her who can help the customer and carry the company's name forward. God bless her!,POSITIVE\r\n",

      "772,\"When it comes to Online Jewellery Shopping, there are very few trustworthy e-sites. Caratlane drew my attention being the official Tanishq partner. The designs available on the portal are unique and on of its kind. I chose one Unique looking Necklace and added it to my wish list and thought of purchasing it after couple of days. When I logged back in, the product was out of stock and the error shown was quite misleading(which I believe needs a Fix by the Tech Team @ Caratlane) Being my Anniversary Present, I was bit choosy over the product design and wanted the same design necklace. This is where I got the assistance from Caratlane Customer Representatives: Ms Mona Dhamankar and Mr Vishant S. Caratlane Representatives were really helpful and the best part is that Caratlane Team offers a dedicated Sales Representative for every customer who wants to place the customized order and you will get 100% assistance from the Representative till the order gets delivered. In my case, I finally got the same Design Customized Necklace(Thanks to Ms. Mona) but was sceptical about the delivery deadlines as excepted delivery date was 20th Nov'17 and I needed it on 12th Nov'17. But even in this situation, the Caratlane Team stepped in and surprised me with the Overnight delivery of product on 11th Nov'17 itself. Along with the Necklace, I received a special Gift Hamper from the CaratLane as my Anniversary Present. A Special thanks to Caratlane Team(Ms Mona/Mr Vishant) for making my Anniversary Day a memorable one. If anyone looking for a Reliable and Trustworthy Hub for Online Jewellery Shipping without facing the Hassle of Offline Retail Shopping, I would Strongly recommend CaratLane for them! Overall I would Rate CaratLane 4/5, with 100% Customer Satisfaction and dedicated assistance. The only downside is that the iOS app/web portal do not reflect the current order Status properly and the Site Cache Handling is poor when it comes to refresh the product stock in real-time.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "775,\"I had recently ordered 5 items from Caratlane.com. It was one of my worst experience I ever had buying things online. a very special online company which doesnt update order statuses. Even after delivering the item, it shows “Solitaire order placed” Never honour their delivery commitment. It would always be late by a week atleast. Their delivery team would drop the order with security guard without asking/ notifying you. And you could never track your order online as I explained in first point. Change in the product actual weight from what you ordered is a norm for the rather than exception. My suggestion: buy from store or Bluestone. Bluestone team experience was awesome.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "776,I ordered a necklace from caratlane. The experience was wonderful as the executives we're very informative and polite. The logistics executive Mr. S. Roy too was very polite and reassuring. Good to know we have a show room in Kolkata. Thank you Caratlane.,POSITIVE\r\n",

      "845,\"Hi friends, I want to share my review on Bluestone.com and it is an online shopping website and it is not a trusted website and the products available on this website are of low quality and the cost of the items are also high and there is a delay in delivery time.Customer service: The customer service offered by this shopping is very poor and they are irresponsible in their duties even though we call in exact time they say that refund cannot be proceeded and very much irritated. Product quality: The product quality is very poor and they are not up to the mark and they are not satisfying the wants of the customers by giving them the good quality of items Delivery time: The time delay is maintained in the delivery time and they take more time to deliver the product to customers after delivering the items is not at all good. App and the website: The app takes more time to load and it consumes more data while downloading using the internet. Reliability: The reliability of this website is very less and durability of the items is also more it is cheap model items are available on this website. Finally, I won't recommend this website to anyone. Thank you\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "857,\"I asked for 4 products for home demo and gave the code to them and fixed an appointment, but on the scheduled date the representative(Mr. Lalit) called me and asked to text him the product code again and after doing that as well he came with only two products. Still I ordered it via Lalit only as he seems a nice person but, he was a true salesman(giving some false information/giving modified informations which will are in his favor). He took the phone numbers and email-id by giving false informations so that this site can spam me by sending mails. Also he did some promises that he did not fulfilled and on calling him he did one of the promised thing. The products are good but do not order it via their field representatives and also the customer support that is on chat on their website is not trustworthy at all. Better to go to some branded stores and buy the products from there.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "858,\"Dear Friend I bought Pair of gold earing from Bluestone, Now I want to return it. Market Value of these products are quite low that the reason they only replace things and not giving you refund. they are making their customer into vicious circle, where they cannot come out even if they want to. My advise to all buyer not to get into these type of shopping as they are very fast when they want to sell their products and they will vanish out when you want to replace your items. They will give you less value and silly reasons to avoid you. Regards\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

      "860,\"Bluestone is a good site for buying jewellery online. My first experience was very good and I remember it till now. I wanted to buy a diamond necklace for my mom as her birthday was coming. I decided to buy it online and then I saw bluestone.com. The site was very light it loaded up in seconds. I saw many designs of diamond necklace and was feeling confused which should I buy after contacting their customer support I got to know that their executive can visit us with jewellery that we select.

      "I am an avid e-shopper. Never been treated so shoddily and unprofessionally by customer service of any e-retailer.

      "946,\"Alright, so here I am sharing my story with GemPundit, I wanted an opal ring with SPECIFIC design what other jwellers denied to make it and I was very disappointed about it but luckly, I get to know about GemPundit via online search and they have solved all my queries about stone and ring design in a single call conversation and I amazed with the final product in terms of stone quality and ring design I recived from them, My case was handled by Mr Rudra Singh and service provided by him was excellent thats why all the 5 stars goes to him!\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "947,\"Though I purchased a blue topaz silver ring which was purely for non astrological purposes, I am very happy with the ring. Great support by the team and they stayed in touch throughout the making process. However it would be really nice if they made customizable gemstone jewellery .Also dimensions of each gemstone should be clearly mentioned.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "948,\"I purchased Pitambari Neelam from Gempundit, being first timer, I was initially sceptical about product, price, quality, delivery and service. I did research in the market as well as internet about the same but I was not getting the similar product at same price. Gempundit offered me the best price for the product, by understanding my requirement and budget. After getting the product, I once thought to return it(as I got little doubt about the product by seeing a natural inclusion), for that also they happily accepted and advised me as how can I go for it. Then I took it to couple of gemmologists and got it verified where I got positive response and so I dropped my plan to return. Thereafter I went to couple of jewellers for making the ring for which they refused saying that I should get the ring done with the same place from where I bought the stone as they didn't want to take the risk of stone getting broke during making of ring, hence again came back to gempundit asking for getting my ring done, this they accepted happily and advised accordingly. Now I got my ring and very happy with their service and I will definitely go back to them only for any gemstones. My special thanks to Shailendra of Gempundit. Regards -Paresh\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "949,I bought a blue sapphire from them. They have a very aggressive/proactive marketing people but the product delivered was substandard. stone has big inclusions and hardly worth the 80k I paid. The picture on the website was misleading and they never did provide the certificate which was promised as per the web listing and at the time of sale. They somehow'lost' it.,NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "950,\"I ordered about 12 products from Wooden Street for my new place early this year. Delivery arrived almost 4 months after order was given.   Do take note ppl the negative reviews are ALL true.  I am 99% sure every customer of wooden street will hear about how heavy rains disrupted their production even during the driest of months. I DEMANDED pictures of the products of mine in production in the 3rd month because I started doubting whether they have even begun the manufacturing process.  The sales person who very eagerly took my money when I ordered the products only sent me photos after my 3rd or 4th email. Before I got the photos I received I think 3 messages, via email and whatsapp.  1st one highlighted that she was ill so she could not attend my case, second message about her sick relative, the last one really was the best, she is having Lunch.  Please take note after they collect the cheque somehow the sales people in wooden street think their job is ended. After looking at the photos I immediately rejected 2 items.  They totally did not look like the pictures in the website.  Once again sales person went missing and after a few days she send me a message educating me on her job scope.  Basically it is to take order from client and collect payment. I had to thus call their amazing hotline and an individual from the customer sales dept took down my request for cancellation.  I believe he send me an email the very next day telling me they are willing to accept cancellation for 1 product but not for the other. They were willing to accept cancellation for 1 of them because the difference between what they made was totally different from what I had ordered.  I am not talking about design or dimensions.  It was completely different. The other they were not willing because according to him the ‘product is correct though it might not look like the furniture in the website’. I just politely told him, I did not pay for surprises.  Later I got an email confirming cancellation for both.  They were willing to cancel because I only paid 80% upfront and 20% on delivery.  So to those who after reading what I have to say still wish to purchase from Woodenstreet, please take note that their policy of 100% upfront is bullshit.Finally delivery date.  I was informed by a totally different person from whoever I talked to before, on the very day that they have scheduled to deliver that evening.  I asked him who did you schedule with and how can you decide all by yourself that I must drop everything and be ready for your delivery when I am informed at 1 pm.  After about 5 calls to the sales person, delivery person and the customer service support person delivery was scheduled for a different date.  Please take note as a customer you have to do this all by yourself. Delivery arrived on Sunday and unfortunately I had to reject another rubbish product after assembly.  I looked at the delivery guy, printed out the image of what I ordered and asked him, does this garbage look like the picture.  And yet again another employee from wooden street educated me on their job scope, “I deliver and assemble only”.  Again I had to make tons of phone calls to request for revised amount after taking into account the latest cancellation.   After about 1.5 hours of calls and waiting the delivery quoted me a different amount from the sales person.  I literally screamed at the sales person and once again she educated me about how lucky I am because she normally strictly does not work on Sundays.  Even paying balance amount is a problem. Conclusion:  3 cancelled pieces out of 12 ordered.  From Woodenstreet, you can be sure 25% will be completely what you did not order.  Out of the 9 remaining pieces, I am happy with 6 of them.  The other 3 I have to learn to compromise to live with, as I am out of energy to argue with them.  So net net you can safely say you will be happy with only 50% of what you ordered.  And I would like to remind everyone I DID NOT do any customization.  Its amazing that an online shop can’t even get their products made as per their pictures that they have displayed in their website. Sales person is the most useless I have seen.  Only concerned for commission.  I have met many sales people in my life but never have I met a sales staff who suffers from constant inertia.  After collecting the money she becomes a teacher and educates you on why she cannot do anything about everything. Many people have reviewed that woodenstreet suffers from a lot of internal miscommunication.   The truth is they do not communicate at all.  Every department behaves as though they have their own immigration counter and you have to go through a security check every step of the way. Final Point – DO NOT pay 100% upfront.  If you do and you try to get a refund you would now have to face their infamous TRY OUR BEST TO NEVER REFUND Dept. I sincerely hope that wooden street will tell the truth in their ABOUT US page. We would make you 50% satisfied. Our sales people are only order takers.  Their professionalism is limited to lies. Our Delivery scheduling is last minute and at our convenience, not yours. You have to wait 100 days minimum we lie about the 5 – 7 weeks estimated delivery.  If you believe it you are a fool.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "951,\"I bulk ordered from Woodenstreet including a bed that costed me almost 40K. The wood started falling off from different places within 3 months of delivery. A complain was raised against it in August 2017. It's been 4 months now, and the issue has still not been resolved. Issues: Poor Quality: We pay premium price for these furnitures expecting them to be of solid wood, and good quality. Not true. Poor Customer Service: The customer service is atrocious. There is no coordination between local representatives and Woodenstreet people. They canceled appointments on me for at least 15 times, never sent people on time to check, never met the promised delivery dates. Furthermore, everytime you email them, they will either not respond to you, or give you a canned reply that does not take you anywhere. Lack professional ethics and accountability: The local representatives initially mentioned that it was raw wood and therefore, needs to be replaced. They conveyed the same to Woodenstreet. However, the very next day, I still get an email saying they will pick it up for a repair. No Timeliness: There is really no commitment to time that they have. It's been 4 months and my issue is still open. And we still do not have a deadline to its closure. No product guarantee and quality ownership: There is no refund for poor quality product. If you once buy a furniture from Woodenstreet, you are stuck with it. Whether it falls off, or is rotten, or any major issue. Their claims of high quality product and being proud of it is a total lie. My Recommendation: Please DO NOT buy anything from Woodenstreet. Not only is the quality poor, their customer service sucks extremely. The price you pay is totally not worth the value. You could get more decent quality product from other places, with much better follow-ups and timeliness.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "952,I have ordered King Sized bed in Rosewood(Sesemwood). The product quality and built is excellent and price is also very low compared to market rate in Bangalore. You need to be very patience with Woodenstreet delivery. Usually they take longer time than committed time to delivery the product. The promised me 6 week but I got the product only after 2 week delay i.e 8 week . Compared to the quality of product delivered the waiting time is manageable,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "953,\"I bought furniture directly from store, I loved the collection and free laptop table is was cherry on cake to me. If you are looking for solid wood furniture, you should definitely visit woodenstreet once. I must say staff over there is very good nature people. I went there and was all sweaty and thirsty .they offered me cold drink and asked me to relax before anything.and I got the detailed information about the product. The only drawback is its quite inside the main road\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "954,\"Booked a bunk bed and sofa cum bed through Order id: 22840 and had received them as mentioned in the website. Products are very nice and the wood finishing is good. Took two months time from the order to delivering the products which was mentioned before and was acceptable as the products were started only after the payment and design are confirmed. Had asked for a customization in the bunk bed, was given drawings, got confirmation from myside only then the product was started manufacturing. The wood quality was fine and the products are heavy because of the solid wood. Packing was excellent and had took lot of care so that there are no scratches on the products. Person had came all the way from Jaipur in the lorry along with the shipment and had delivered on to the fourth floor without any extra payment. The only hiccup for my order is the installation of the products which had a slight delay but was done properly by a third party carpenter'TappMe'. Installation was also done without any payment to the third party.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "955,\"Recently I placed an order for ariana 6 seat dining table with the WOODENSTREET furniture store online after a good online research looking for the best product at affordable price.so I finally landed at WOODENSTREET.com. in the beginning I was skittle hesitant to place the order because it involved spending 50k rs but I could not resist beautiful exceptional designs offered by WOODENSTREET. The best part is they provide customisation of the HIGHEST ORDER AND KEEP EXCELLENT RAPPORT WITH THE CUSTOMER. IT took 7 weeks for the product to be delivered as promised by the company. There was just 1day delay and some hesitation but the the beauty and the quality of the product delivered brought a big smile on everybody's face in the family. The PRODUCT IS SIMPLY GREAT IN EVERYTHING. LIKE QUALITY, FINISHING, DETAILING, PERFECTION AND MANY more things. Only the most seasoned artisans could create something like that. IT IS MAMMOTH, HEAVY, TOUGH, ELEGANT, AND LOOKS AMAAZING FROM ANY ANGLE EVRY ANGLE. Thank you soooooo much WOODENSTREET thank you soooooo much . Those who saw the product like my relatives, and neighbours could not stop looking at it and praising the craftsmanship and are eager to place orders with WOODENSTREET . I will suggest anybody for the exquisite quality product ONLY FROM WOODENSTREET .IL CONTINUE TO BUY OTHER PRODUCTS FROM WOODENSTREET. TJANK YOU WOODENSTREET ONCE AGAIN FORAKING US JOYFUL AND BEAUTIFULLY DECORATING OUR LOVELY HOME\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "956,\"Never had I thought that I'd get such an amazing dining table. I have looked for such ingenious products all my life, and my search ended at Woodenstreet. Their customer support was more than happy to help me. They assured me that the product will be provided in the finish that I had selected. The design was a Cohoon dining table, a four seater. Really ingenious design. The delivery was done within 5 weeks, as they had promised. So jo worries there. The delivery team assembled the table in the living room and cleaned up after their work was done. There were no problem at all with this. Finally, all that I have to say is that I am completely satisfied with my brand new dining table. It looks fantastic and is very strong. Having a meal on it is always a pleasure. My thanks goes to Woodenstreet for this amazingly designed product.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "957,\"Buying furniture for our new home was not a task, it was a responsibility. My wife took this responsibility and started searching for a sofa that would fit our apartment. When she showed me the Margret 3 seater sofa on WoodenStreet.com, I liked it very much. After surfing more we ended up with a Margret 3 Seater Sofa and an Alpina Lounge Chair to complete the set. She wanted something unique, and fortunately, Wooden Street has its Experience Store in Bangalore. The staff guided us well to finalize our order. We had it customized to a floral fabric pattern, and they happily obliged. Finally, after 4 weeks our order arrived. I loved the style, colour and print of the set and it fits perfectly in my home and is just the right size to provide comfortable seating without overwhelming the room. it looks amazing with the overall interior of my living room. It perfectly compliments and replicates colors used in the room. It is a beautiful and artfully designed piece of furniture that we will use for years. Lovely design! Thank you Wooden Street.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "958,\"My experience with Woodenstreet has been pretty good. I had ordered a TV unit and after 2 months because of rainy season the wood expanded and the doors were not getting closed. I contacted customer care centre, where Tanvi helped to scheduled a carpenter visit to look into the same in next 3 days. The carpenter was experienced. He took care of the problem and now my TV unit is perfect.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "959,\"I have placed few orders at woodenstreet.com worth of few lacs at first instance itself after looking at their website with so great features and insight into the product's details and talking to their customer care. Initially, I have been bit nervous but trust me product were really so amazing, genuine and finishing was so great. The products have been amazing, though they can improve upon shortening the delivery of the product. Apart from this I don't have any other concerns. Well done woodenstreet & keep it up!\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "960,\"I ordered king size bed which got delivered little late than expected. Expected delivery was 5-7 weeks but got delivered in 9 weeks.(As per sales team) This was because of heavy rain and  polish was not not getting dry due to rain i.e.( which looks genuine reason to  me.) I appreciate on quality of product they give is really worth and value for money. Upon delivery,  there was some minor scratches due to transport but got fixed by local carpenter which was arranged by them. Carpenters were well trained and handled properly within an hour to fix minor defects which was due to transport. My total experience was at end satusfactory. Expecting in future QC check and delivery of item will be more accurate. Overall very good and happy with the product and services.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "961,\"I have had good experience of shopping with woodenstreet.com I recently baught a sofa bed from their Website. It is really comfortable and stylish. The collection I found of woodenstreet as per with other website, like urban ledder, pepperfry and fab furnish. I got the product custom made as per myy needs and really good.You just need to fillup the form and they will contact you to confirm your requirements and dimensions.Overall, the Quality of product is great it is solid and feels durable.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "962,\"I ordered 3 king size beds & one coffee table. This feedback is based on other competitive products in the market(based @Bangalore). My rating is 3.5 since system does not provide half point hence I provided 4 rating. Time line for delivery: Customer should have patience as time line is very long(standard product). Any customization may take more time. Cost: Standard products are priced competitively, but any customization cost becomes non-competitive(higher than others). Delivery at home: This needs improvement, carpenter needs to have sense of cleanliness and respect for other furniture and fixtures. Quality of fitment: This needs serious attention as products directly do not fit hence carpenters are needed to make adjustment as well as fine tune almost every fittings, as well as proper marking of each parts which goes where, wood cuts must be straight line etc.(factory quality issue). Quality of wood: Hardwood quality is good, MDF used is greenply(standard option should also provide plywood with reasonable price option), plywood is considered as customization, as mentioned any customization comes with additional higher cost. Quality of roller: Plastic / PVC roller used in the bed pull out drawer can be little higher quality.\r\n",
      "Needs improvement on customer follow-up and respect for commitment. Special mention of Tanvi who did manage last minute issues and addressed most of the concerns(hope others can follow the same).\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
      "963,\"I had ordered Pooja Mandir from Woodenstreet, I had customised the drawer height, so they noted the same and they sent the drawing with the dimensions for order confirmation. Once the order is confirmed, the order is transferred to the coordinator, then I had requested the coordinator to send me the pictures of pooja mandir before they polish, the had sent the same as per the request and once I had given confirmation, they did the polishing and sent the mandir to my home. Pooja mandir looked and felt great, and there was one small issue with glass fitment, so I had complained the same to the coordinator and they had arranged a carpenter to home to correct it.(it took little bit time for the carpenter arrangement which they can improve in future cases). Overall it is great experience with woodenstreet.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "964,\"I bought a coffee table and a sideboard from woodenstreet. Extremely happy and satisfied with the products. The wood quality and design are as expected. Had a pleasant experience during interaction with representatives, specifically for the customization that we required. The detailed \"\"order description form\"\" explaining the final product specifications that was sent to us after customization was very clear and helpful to visualize the final product. Keep up the good work and Wish you all the best at woodenstreet.com\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "965,\"I brought Steve compact 6 seater dining set, It took the standard time that was mentioned during the purchase. On regular basis I was informed on the status and progress of the product. From the shipment to installation took less then 1 week time reaching Bangalore. The product finish is superb and accurate to the picture that we saw online. We normally are scared to buy products online as we can't see and feel it. When I received the product I was very happy and feel satisfied to have made the right choice going with Wooden Street. From the sales and manufacturing team - Shyam and Simran has regularly informed on the present status. The installation team was wonderful specially Vikram. Thanks Team, you guys are fantastic!\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "966,\"Ordered a hydraulic King size bed and a Shoe rack, both have met my expectations. the quality of the wood is nice and solid, but the most impressive is their customer service. Its a great site to order from. The app and the website is very user friendly too here I would like to emphasise on the chat section which is very efficient in case of any enquiries. would like to wish Woodenstreet all the best in their future.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "967,\"Ordered a study table and chair for my son. Good attention to detail, they called up and informed that the chair I had selected would not fit with the table and had to be altered in size. Took more than 6 weeks to arrive, but product quality is good and as per specification on the website. The Installation team was professional and did a good job. Overall satisfied with the experience. If only delivery time can be reduced, it will help in making the whole experience even better.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "968,\"\"\" They delivered my king size bed to ahmedabad. I never heard about them earlier but I was quite satisfied by the wood quality and making. Timeliness of delivery was also accurate.Delivery and installation was free. I would surely purchase again and also recommend to friends and family.Happily satisfied.:-) \"\"\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "969,\"Hi Netizens, I ordered a center table for my beautiful home which we recently shifted into. After going through so many online catalogs and websites, we stumbled upon Wooden street. To be honest, I have never heard of its name among the pepper fry, urban ladder, royal oak etc. But in the search of the last piece in our decor, we started browsing. And we were in luck! They had variety, customization, offer prices, colors and everything we were looking for. After a considerable amount of debate, me and my husband zeroed in on lovely coffee table with Honey finish. And it finally arrived yesterday! The value for money, finishing, product itself is great. And did I mention that we love the color:) I am rating it 4 star because only thing I felt they can definitely improvise on is user interaction when the order is placed. When we ordered, we were under impression that it will be delivered within 1-2 weeks but it took almost a month because they needed to manufacture it. Probably they can have a disclaimer at the start itself to give customer a proper picture. But other than that, I love it. It was worth the wait. Keep up the good work!\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "970,I ordered a TV cabinet from Wooden Street. The product was delivered before the promised time and the cabinet just enhanced the ambience of the entire room. Finishing is superb. The customer reps made it easy to order online and were cordial n pleasant. Very happy!,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "971,I have purchased the Samboy Loft collection from woodenstreet for our new resort in Goa. I have feedback for the entire team while they did put great efforts in helping me place a successfully delivered order. I initially interacted with Bharti on chat she assisted me in passing on the conversation to an executive called Ashish. I had no customization in dimensions but only asked if my delivery can be made in 50days in Goa with a glossy finish and durable furniture with warranty. They promised me to do so and even after I had requested for more time in dispatching the products since my resort was under painting services the delivery team in goa kept the furniture well and safe in their warehouse for almost 2 weeks . People are in love with my collection and its very rare which is not available around. Thanks I am getting great visitors and their stay is comfortable . Cheers to whole team for helping me complete my project!,POSITIVE\r\n",
      "972,\"I ordered a bed and a dining table(2 huge purchases) and this was my first time buying from Wooden Street. I was really impressed with the range of products they have to offer(across a wide price range). The delivery timelines are the only drawback in my opinion, thought to be honest they do mention on the site that it will take at least 8 weeks for the delivery. The products are packed really well, and delivered in the exact same state as they are shown on the site. The customer service is also pretty prompt and responsive. I really loved the Wooden Street experience and would buy from them again in the future. Highly recommended.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "973,\"We ordered a TV unit and a coffee table. Both have excellent Finish. We visited the godown which is in Koregaon park, Pune. The staff is very polite. There were many good options available on the portal. Very accurate dimensions, good quality wood and option to select type of wood before ordering. Can compare it with our experience with local furniture stores. Other portals do not offer customization and choice if finish. Time taken but then good things come to those who wait.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "974,\"We have bought a King size cot and Dining set from wooden street. I do really like the quality of products. However the delivery time takes couple of months, the wait is worth. The best part is, we can do customisation of almost any furniture. I would like to appreciate the delivery guy and carpenter who were extremely polite in addressing any concern. The overall experience with Wooden Street is good! Keep it up guys!\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "975,\"I have ordered twice from Wooden street and both times the experience has been good. Yes, the orders do take time to be delivered, however you are informed that it would take 5-7 weeks for the delivery. I have bought a study table, pretty sturdy one. Recently a book case, side cabinet and am awaiting the delivery of shoe rack. Our liasion person here in Chennai is a pleasent chap who promptly responds to our queries. So far I haven't had any major issues with the products. The side cabinet requires some minor fixing up which they have promised to do it. The advantages I have found with wooden street is that, you can customize your order, which not many others entertain. Also, we can time the delivery at your convenience, they accommodate that. If required I will certainly consider wooden street for my next buy.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "976,\"I brought a Murphy Table last December. Although the website mentioned that table would be delivered in 14 days, I got another mail telling that it would be delayed. When I complained about this, the matter was promptly addressed. Himani handled my order and requested for two week extension and I agreed. As promised, the table came within the promised date. The entire team was quite professional even Harshvardhan who delivered it. I was impressed by the conduct.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "977,\"My experience with Wooden street team went so well in all respects during my first purchase of Heling King Size Bed and Rocking Chair on 23rd Feb 2017. I randomly searched the site and found the products are so unique and exclusive, I had a chat with the team from the website itself and enquired about the product, pricing and its offers and found them satisfactory in comparison with the products available in the market. I have placed the order on the very same day, since then, I had been guided by their sales and operations team and advised step by stem progress of making of the product, shipment date and expected date of delivery. My calls and mails were promptly attended by Mr Shyam, Ms Himani and Mr Hemant with utmost sincerity and given the assurance from time to time on progress. Both the products were received as appeared in the web site(with negligible variations) and delivered as per the scheduled committed by them. I once again thanks to all the team and the management for their support and commitment.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "978,\"They have a very friendly CC and they really are professional. They assist very fast and promptly. I had a strange initial experience. There were a misunderstanding with the fabrication of 2 3-seater sofas. These things can happen. After some calls and emails, they completely understood the issue and automatically did their best to correct and solve the situation. And they really did it. This is a very good point as they are completely reliable. From a uh-uh perception to a completely satisfactory experience. It has been a pleasure to deal with them, absolutely.\",POSITIVE\r\n",
      "979,\"I had ordered a vector sideboard from wooden street. Being a new company and also located outside Mumbai, I was a little apprehensive. But I liked the design and the price looked betterv than the competition, so I decided to take a risk, and I am happy that I did it. Their customer service people were very good and they knew what they were talking, not reading a script which sadly is the case at many places nowadays. They also gave me offer to customize at no cost, which was very good. Payment was hassle free as they accepted amex, which was good. I received the product on time and am very happy with it. The delivery boy didn't ask for chai-paani, instead asked for feedback, which I really liked. I really thought that start ups like this should be encouraged to flourish so that the customers like us get more choices and get the benefit of competition. I will recommend them and will order again. Attaching a pic of my side board.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "981,\"I recently bought few Tamil novels using Udumalai.com. I am able to find the Tamil books what I want to buy which is usually not available in any other online shopping portal. There is also a option to pay at cash on delivery, so there is no need to worry about your money and reliability. And they also delivered books without any transport damages. I prefer this Udumalai.com to buy Tamil novels. In this website they are also selling footwear and apparels.\",POSITIVE\r\n",

      "984,\"I made my first purchase during GoSF 2014 and it made me realise how bad customer care services can be. Dealing with the customer care was no less than a nightmare for me. They are clearly unable to deliever orders and if at all it is delievered than there are very high chances of low quality or fake products. Multiple follow-ups, a petition on change.org made them to call me up. The product I ordered with some coupon was never ordered. Its a cheating company be aware, worst customer care, worst ethics. My order was cancelled after 26 days and no refund was made. This led me file a case against this fraud in the consumer forum. So there is no point in being fooled by them.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",

I was really angry now, and then I received a call saying \"\"sir you are our homeshop18 lucky customer and have won 1st prize in the lucky draw contest\"\" I asked what is the prize? they replied \"\"you have won XUV 500 car worth rupees 15 lakh!\"\" I was surprised and knew that something was fishy so I asked how to avail the gift, the guy replied \"\" sir you just have to register the car by paying 12000 rupees and you can get the car or the money\"\" I then realised it was a fraud call by homeshop18, and he blocked me then. the delivery time is worst, reliability is none, the offers are just to lure you into buying them and product quality is very poor.\",NEGATIVE\r\n",
